# CTRL FreaQ UI/UX Specification

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for CTRL FreaQ's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

## Introduction

Based on analysis of the existing Lovable.ai implementation, this specification documents CTRL FreaQ's current state as a document/content management system for teams and provides an improvement roadmap for developers implementing UI enhancements. The current implementation demonstrates a solid foundation with React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components, integrated with Clerk authentication and featuring a responsive dashboard layout with project management capabilities.

Key improvement opportunities identified include enhanced document editing workflows, advanced collaboration features, improved mobile responsiveness, and expanded accessibility compliance.

## Overall UX Goals & Principles

### Target User Personas

**Senior/Staff+ Engineers & Tech Leads**
- Technical professionals adopting AI-assisted development workflows
- Primary need: Creating detailed, AI-optimized architecture documentation efficiently
- Context: Experienced developers who often deprioritize rigorous documentation
- Goal: Reduce "vibe coding" through structured, validated, machine-consumable artifacts

**Engineering Managers & Platform Leads** 
- Secondary users focused on team productivity and documentation standards
- Need oversight of documentation quality and team collaboration
- Value traceability between requirements, architecture, and implementation decisions

### Usability Goals

**Speed & Quality Balance**: Users can complete first usable architecture draft within 60 minutes while maintaining comprehensive documentation quality

**AI-Human Collaboration Efficiency**: 30% reduction in prompt crafting time through seamless human-AI interaction patterns and contextual assistance

**Iterative Refinement**: Maximum 2 revision cycles to reach "architecture approved" status through guided workflows and quality gates

**Developer-Familiar Patterns**: Leverage familiar concepts (Git-style patching, section-based editing, diff previews) to reduce cognitive load

**Context Preservation**: Maintain conversation context across sections and editing sessions to support coherent document development

### Design Principles

1. **AI as Collaborative Partner** - Design AI interactions as conversation with an intelligent colleague, not tool usage
2. **Human Agency First** - Users maintain control over all decisions; AI provides suggestions that require explicit approval
3. **Progressive Context Building** - Each interaction builds on previous context, creating increasingly refined and personalized assistance
4. **Transparent AI Reasoning** - Show rationale behind AI suggestions to build trust and enable informed decision-making
5. **Seamless Flow Transitions** - Smooth movement between reading, editing, AI consultation, and approval workflows

- Section spacing: 1.5rem (24px) between major elements
- Document padding: 2rem (32px) for main content areas

## Accessibility Requirements

### Compliance Target
**Standard:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with progressive enhancement toward AAA where feasible

### Key Requirements

**Visual:**
- Color contrast ratios: 4.5:1 minimum for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Focus indicators: 2px solid focus ring with high contrast
- Text sizing: Minimum 16px base size, scalable to 200% without horizontal scrolling

**Interaction:**
- Keyboard navigation: Full keyboard accessibility for all AI interactions
- Screen reader support: Proper ARIA labels for AI states and streaming content
- Touch targets: Minimum 44px for mobile interactions, especially floating AI assistant

**Content:**
- Alternative text: Descriptive alt text for all visual AI feedback and status indicators
- Heading structure: Proper H1-H6 hierarchy matching document section structure
- Form labels: Clear labeling for all assumption resolution and input interfaces

### Testing Strategy
- Automated accessibility testing integrated with CI/CD pipeline
- Manual keyboard navigation testing for complex AI interaction flows
- Screen reader testing with NVDA/JAWS for AI conversation interfaces
- Color contrast validation for all AI-specific visual states

## Responsiveness Strategy

### Breakpoints
| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Mobile | 320px | 767px | Smartphones, basic document reading |
| Tablet | 768px | 1023px | Tablets, light document editing |
| Desktop | 1024px | 1439px | Laptops, full document creation |
| Wide | 1440px | - | Large screens, multi-document workflows |

### Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes:**
- Mobile: Single column, collapsed sidebar, simplified AI assistant
- Tablet: Flexible two-column with collapsible panels
- Desktop: Full three-column layout (sidebar, content, AI assistant)
- Wide: Optional fourth column for advanced features (traceability, history)

**Navigation Changes:**
- Mobile: Bottom navigation bar with hamburger menu
- Tablet: Collapsible sidebar with gesture support
- Desktop: Persistent sidebar with full navigation hierarchy
- Wide: Enhanced sidebar with expanded AI conversation history

**Content Priority:**
- Mobile: Document reading optimized, basic editing only
- Tablet: Full editing capabilities with touch-optimized controls
- Desktop: Complete document creation and AI collaboration
- Wide: Advanced features like side-by-side document comparison

**Interaction Changes:**
- Mobile: Touch gestures for navigation, simplified AI chat
- Tablet: Hybrid touch/pointer support, resizable AI assistant
- Desktop: Full keyboard shortcuts, drag-and-drop positioning
- Wide: Advanced keyboard shortcuts, multi-window workflows

## Animation & Micro-interactions

### Motion Principles
**AI-Responsive Animation:** Subtle animations that communicate AI processing state and provide feedback for human-AI collaboration. Animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility settings and can be globally disabled.

### Key Animations
- **AI Thinking Indicator:** Subtle pulsing animation during AI processing (Duration: 1.5s, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Section State Transitions:** Smooth color/border transitions between section states (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Floating Assistant Movement:** Physics-based positioning with snap-to-grid behavior (Duration: 300ms, Easing: cubic-bezier(0.2, 0, 0, 1))
- **Streaming Response Animation:** Progressive text reveal during AI response generation (Duration: Variable, Easing: linear)
- **Quality Gate Feedback:** Status badge color transitions with subtle bounce effect (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-bounce)
- **Diff Highlight Animation:** Subtle highlight fade-in for proposed changes (Duration: 400ms, Easing: ease-in-out)

## Performance Considerations

### Performance Goals
- **Page Load:** ≤ 2s Time to First Meaningful Paint on broadband
- **Interaction Response:** ≤ 100ms for local interactions, ≤ 300ms for AI responses
- **Document Rendering:** Full document render without lazy loading, optimized for documents up to 500 sections

### Design Strategies
**AI Optimization:** Streaming UI updates for AI responses to maintain perceived performance during longer processing times. Use skeleton screens and progressive enhancement for AI-dependent features.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Create Figma Design System** - Build comprehensive component library based on specifications
2. **Prototype AI Interactions** - Create interactive prototypes for floating assistant and assumption resolution flows  
3. **Validate Information Architecture** - User testing of navigation structure and document editor workflow
4. **Technical Architecture Handoff** - Provide detailed specifications to development team for implementation planning
