# Goals and Background Context
## Goals
- Accelerate high-quality AI-assisted development by generating AI-optimized product and architecture documentation.
- Increase successful LLM-driven implementation rate via AI-ready Architecture specs for MVP projects.
- Reduce PR churn and rework caused by unclear requirements/architecture.
- Establish an MCP-native knowledge base (coding standards, patterns, decisions) to improve agent retrieval quality.
- Maintain near-zero baseline platform cost using AWS serverless.
- Deliver MVP outcomes: AI-optimized Architecture doc; MCP read endpoints; conversational co-authoring; update existing docs; basic collaboration; quality gates and traceability.

## Background Context
CRTL FreaQ is an interactive system leveraging AI with human-in-the-loop flows to produce the documentation required to build software, from Brief/PRD through Epics/Stories, Front-End Spec, and Architecture. The MVP focuses on a deeply detailed, AI-optimized Architecture document (assuming Brief/PRD exist) and an MCP server that allows LLMs to query authoritative product/architecture knowledge.

The problem: experienced developers often deprioritize rigorous documentation, leading to inconsistent, low-quality LLM outputs and "vibe coding." Existing instruction-heavy LLM approaches produce variable results; static templates and scattered knowledge bases are not machine-consumable or MCP/query-friendly. CRTL FreaQ addresses this by enforcing structured, validated, machine-consumable artifacts and exposing them via MCP for deterministic grounding.
