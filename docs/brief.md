# Project Brief: CRTL FreaQ

## Executive Summary

- Concept: CRTL FreaQ is an interactive system that uses AI with
  human-in-the-loop flows to generate the core documentation needed to build
  software, from Product Brief document and PRD document through the
  Architecture document family (e.g., Frontend Architecture document, Backend
  Architecture document) and Front-End Spec document; it explicitly excludes
  Epics/Stories tooling. The MVP focuses on producing a highly detailed,
  AI-optimized Architecture document (assuming the Brief document and PRD
  document exist) and an authenticated App Layout with a Dashboard and basic
  Projects UI. Documents export as Markdown with frontmatter to
  `docs/architecture.md` and sharded `docs/architecture/*.md` for downstream
  tools like Spec Kit.
- Problem: Experienced developers often skip rigorous documentation, leading to
  inconsistent, low-quality LLM outputs and “vibe coding”.
- Target market: Senior/staff+ engineers and tech leads adopting AI-assisted
  development who want predictable, higher-quality LLM output.
- Value proposition: Accelerate high-quality AI-assisted development by
  generating AI-optimized product and architecture documentation, reducing
  manual effort and improving LLM output quality.

## Problem Statement

### Current State and Pain Points

- Documentation is deprioritized; PRD documents/Architecture documents rarely
  exist in an LLM-ready form, so prompts lack structure and grounding.
- Ad‑hoc prompting and "vibe coding" yield inconsistent outputs; no canonical
  knowledge base (coding standards, patterns, decisions).
- Tribal knowledge is scattered across Notion/Confluence/READMEs and becomes
  stale; hard for humans or LLMs to find and trust.
- No guided flows to produce AI‑optimized documents; high cognitive load and
  tool friction cause developers to skip the work.

### Impact

- Time waste: 3–6 hours/week per engineer lost to prompt crafting,
  re‑contextualizing, and chasing decisions due to missing LLM‑ready docs.
- PR churn: 20–40% of PRs require rework or restarts from unclear/misaligned
  architecture; adds 1–3 extra review cycles.
- Lead time delays: Kickoff to first viable architecture spec often takes 2–5
  days; features slip 1–2 sprints when architecture isn’t solid.
- Defect leakage: 10–20% of bugs stem from requirements/architecture
  misunderstandings that better specs would prevent.
- Onboarding drag: New contributors spend 2–5 days discovering
  standards/patterns, leading to inconsistent outputs and slow ramp.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- Pure LLM-driven methods (e.g., instruction-heavy workflows) rely on
  unpredictable instruction handling; output varies despite consistent intent
  and context.
- Static templates and prompt libraries don’t enforce structured,
  machine-consumable artifacts; results aren’t LLM-ready specs and drift over
  time.
- Existing knowledge bases (Confluence/Notion/READMEs) aren't query-friendly;
  retrieval for LLMs is unreliable and stale.
- Few tools provide guided, human‑in‑the‑loop flows and quality gates to produce
  deterministic documentation that LLMs can reliably consume.

### Urgency

- Market timing: AI-assisted development is accelerating; teams that standardize
  now set the internal bar and reap compounding gains.
- Cost of rework: Inconsistent LLM outputs create escalating rework and PR
  churn; each sprint of “vibe coding” adds avoidable debt.
- Ecosystem shift: Agent patterns are emerging; structured documentation creates
  leverage for tooling and integrations.
- Model volatility: Rapid model changes increase output variance; structured,
  machine-consumable specs hedge against drift.

## Proposed Solution

- Core concept and approach: Provide guided, human-in-the-loop flows that
  produce AI-optimized, machine-consumable artifacts across the lifecycle
  (Product Brief document → PRD document → Front-End Spec document →
  Architecture document; Epics/Stories tooling excluded). Artifacts use
  structured schemas, cross-references, and quality gates so LLMs can reliably
  ground on them. MVP provides manual export (Markdown + frontmatter) to
  `docs/architecture.md` and sharded sections under `docs/architecture/*.md` for
  downstream tools like Spec Kit.
- Key differentiators:
  - AI-optimized documentation structure with validation and traceability
    instead of freeform notes/templates.
  - Developer-first UX with deterministic flows to reduce cognitive load and
    eliminate “vibe coding”.
- MVP focus on a deeply detailed Architecture document designed to guide
  high-quality LLM code generation.
- Why this will succeed: It removes the biggest friction for senior
  developers—creating and maintaining LLM-ready specs—while delivering
  predictable outputs through structured flows. Opinionated quality gates and
  structured data produce consistent, higher-quality code outcomes.
- High-level vision: A unified, interactive UI that converts ideas into
  executable specs, keeps artifacts in sync, and closes the loop with LLMs. Over
  time, expand from Architecture-first to full PRD document/Architecture
  document/Front-End Spec document orchestration with analytics, governance, and
  seamless monorepo integration.

## Target Users

  knowledge sharing.

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Business Objectives

- Increase successful LLM-driven implementation rate by producing AI-ready
  Architecture specs for MVP projects.
- Reduce PR churn and rework driven by unclear requirements/architecture.
- Keep platform costs near-zero at rest using AWS serverless.

### User Success Metrics

- Time to first usable Architecture draft ≤ 60 minutes from kickoff.
- Revision cycles to “architecture approved” ≤ 2 iterations for MVP scope.
- Developers report ≥ 30% reduction in prompt crafting time when building
  features off the spec.

### KPIs

- Draft-to-approve conversion: ≥ 70% of architecture drafts approved within 2
  business days.
- PR churn (LLM-output-related): ≤ 10% of PRs require rework due to
  missing/ambiguous architecture.
- Cost: <$10/month baseline infra; <$0.25 per completed architecture draft in
  variable costs at MVP usage scale.

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

- Document Creation Flow (MVP): Guided, human-in-the-loop flow that outputs a
  deeply detailed, AI-optimized Architecture document from existing Brief/PRD;
  includes schema, cross-references, and decision logs.
- Conversational Co‑Authoring (section-aware chat): Discuss and co-write with
  the LLM during document creation; section-scoped context, suggested
  drafts/edits, inline citations to fields; user approves before changes apply.
- Document QA Chat: Discuss existing docs with the LLM at any time (“explain X”,
  “what’s missing?”, “challenge Y”); answers cite relevant doc sections and
  knowledge sources.
- Update Existing Documents: Open an existing Architecture doc, apply targeted
  edits through guided steps or chat; show diff preview, record
  changelog/version bump.
- Quality Gates & Traceability: Validation checks, acceptance checklist, and a
  lightweight traceability matrix (requirements ↔ architecture components ↔
  decisions).
- Export & Versioning: Markdown export to repo with version markers and
  changelog; simple diff-aware updates.
- Developer-first UI: React UI with Express.js API, guided steps, inline AI
  suggestions, and HITL approvals; local development (low/no base cost).
- Collaboration: Basic multi-user concurrency for document editing (e.g.,
  section locks or last-write-wins with conflict warnings).

### Out of Scope (MVP)

- Full PRD/Brief generation flows (beyond minimal capture for Architecture).
- Multi-tenant org/workspace management and SSO.
- Advanced analytics/dashboards, governance policies, or workflow automations.
- Complex model routing/orchestration; custom plugin marketplace.
- Deep repo scanning/indexing across large monorepos (beyond targeted doc I/O).

### MVP Success Criteria

- Produce an AI-optimized Architecture doc meeting the checklist within ≤ 60
  minutes of kickoff.
- Architecture doc used to guide an LLM to implement a reference feature with ≤
  10% PR churn attributable to missing/ambiguous architecture.
- Baseline infra <$10/month; per-architecture generation cost ≤ $0.25 at MVP
  scale.

## Post-MVP Vision

### Expansion Opportunities

- Verticals & Domain Packs: Fintech, commerce, data/ML, and regulated domains
  with pre‑tuned templates and policies.
- Partnerships/Integrations: GitHub/Atlassian, AWS serverless stack, model
  providers, observability (Datadog), eval tooling (LangSmith).
- Premium/Enterprise: SSO, multi‑workspace/orgs, analytics, SLAs, private
  deployments; training and enablement offerings.
- SDK & Extensibility: Plugin/SDK to define custom schemas and
  organization‑specific quality gates.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Budget:** <$50/mo baseline
- **Timeline:** 6 weeks MVP target
- **Resources:** Solo dev with AI assistants
- **Technical:** Local development (Express.js + Node, SQLite); TypeScript;
  monorepo

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- Adoption friction: Senior devs may resist perceived process overhead despite
  HITL chat.
- Output quality drift: LLM hallucination/model changes could degrade doc
  quality; requires validations/evals.
- UX complexity: Section-aware chat + guided flows can overwhelm if not
  streamlined.
- Consistency/sync: Keeping docs and knowledge sources aligned across edits.
- Cost variance: Model usage may exceed <$50/mo baseline if flows are
  chat-heavy.
- Security: Document access must avoid data leakage; auth/authorization must be
  tight.
- Key management: Each account provides their own LLM API keys initially;
  onboarding and support complexity, secret handling risk.

-### Open Questions

- Auth model: GitHub OAuth vs. email magic link vs. local?
- Collaboration: Decision — basic multi-user concurrency in MVP.
- LLM provider: Decision — OpenAI ChatGPT abstraction via ai-sdk.dev.
- Evaluation plan: What golden set and thresholds for doc quality and generation
  accuracy?
- Diagramming: Decision — basic Mermaid support for architecture visualization.

-### Areas Needing Further Research

- Architecture document formats that maximize downstream code quality
  (comparative review).
- Best practices for section-aware conversational editing and diff application.
- Server frameworks and hosting patterns for scalable deployment.
- Cost modeling of chat/co-authoring flows across model providers.
- Minimal yet effective traceability matrix for MVP.

   `docs/architecture.md`; shards at `docs/architecture/*.md`; idempotent
   export.
4. Decide auth approach (GitHub OAuth vs. magic link) and spike if needed.
5. Scaffold monorepo: `apps/web`, `packages/*`, `docs/*`.
6. Integrate Vercel AI SDK for section‑aware conversational co‑authoring.
7. Implement document storage + versioning strategy (Markdown in `docs/`,
   changelog/version markers).
8. Build quality gates checklist and lightweight traceability matrix; add gates
   to validate frontmatter on export.
9. Configure CI (lint, type‑check, build; optional preview deploy).
10. Create evaluation harness for document QA and generation quality.

-### PM Handoff This Project Brief provides the full context for CRTL FreaQ.
Please start in “PRD Generation Mode”, review the brief thoroughly, and work
with the user to create the PRD section by section as the template indicates,
asking for any necessary clarification or suggesting improvements.

-### Key Assumptions

- Brief document and PRD document are available (or minimally captured) and
  serve as inputs to the MVP Architecture document flow.
- Local MVP development environment available; Node 22 support assumed; low/no
  baseline cost is acceptable.
- Access to chosen LLM(s) for drafting/co‑authoring; no offline requirement.
- Monorepo uses pnpm workspaces + Turborepo with GitHub Actions CI;
  documentation lives under `docs/` with git/changelog versioning.
- No regulated PII processed; logs/telemetry are non‑sensitive; SOC 2 is
  aspirational and not a blocker for MVP.
