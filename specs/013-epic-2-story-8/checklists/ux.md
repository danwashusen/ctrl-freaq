# UX Requirements Checklist — Quality Gates Integration

Purpose: Validate UX requirement quality for quality gate feedback surfaces  
Created: 2025-10-13  
Focus: Section feedback, document dashboard, traceability matrix  
Depth: Standard PR review  
Audience: Feature reviewers

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are section-level feedback requirements explicit about indicator
      locations (sidebar, inline highlights, re-run control) and their states
      for authors? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 1]
- [x] CHK002 Are dashboard UX requirements enumerating all summary elements
      (severity grouping, section shortcuts, publish controls) expected by
      document owners? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 2]
- [x] CHK003 Does the traceability matrix UX include requirements covering
      linked content previews, gate status badges, and timestamps for compliance
      reviewers? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 3]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK004 Are the <2 second validation expectations translated into UI
      messaging or loading affordances so users understand progress? [Clarity,
      Spec §FR-001]
- [x] CHK005 Is "clear messaging" for publish blocking defined with concrete
      content elements or copy guidelines to avoid subjective interpretation?
      [Clarity, Spec §FR-005]
- [x] CHK006 Are remediation guidance requirements specific about format (e.g.,
      bullet list, link type, severity badges) for inline issue details?
      [Clarity, Spec §FR-002]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK007 Do collaborator access statements stay consistent between
      functional requirements and any UX language describing role-based
      capabilities? [Consistency, Spec §FR-011]
- [x] CHK008 Are severity labels and status colors/names aligned across section
      view, dashboard, and traceability entries? [Consistency, Spec §FR-004]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK009 Are survey-based clarity targets (e.g., Likert ≥4) mapped to
      specific UX artifacts or guidance to make them testable? [Acceptance
      Criteria Quality, Spec §SC-005]
- [x] CHK010 Do acceptance tests describing publish blocking reference explicit
      UX states (disabled controls, explanatory dialogs) rather than implicit
      behavior? [Acceptance Criteria Quality, Spec §User Story 2]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK011 Are both automatic debounce-triggered runs and manual re-run
      actions documented with distinct UX expectations? [Scenario Coverage, Spec
      §User Story 1]
- [x] CHK012 Does the dashboard UX specify how all-pass scenarios appear,
      including messaging when no blockers remain? [Scenario Coverage, Spec
      §User Story 2]
- [x] CHK013 Does the traceability UX define reviewer workflows for filtering or
      prioritizing multiple requirements per section, or note if omitted?
      [Scenario Coverage, Gap]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK014 Do UX requirements detail visuals and messaging when the gate
      runner fails or times out, including retry guidance? [Edge Case Coverage,
      Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK015 Is the neutral status for never-edited sections described with
      iconography or color usage so authors recognize it? [Edge Case Coverage,
      Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK016 Are orphaned requirement notifications clarified for document
      owners (location, urgency cues) when coverage disappears? [Edge Case
      Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK017 Are accessibility expectations (ARIA announcements, focus order,
      contrast) documented for indicators, dashboard tables, and traceability
      views? [Non-Functional Requirements, Gap]
- [x] CHK018 Are localization or terminology consistency requirements captured
      for gate statuses and remediation text across locales? [Non-Functional
      Requirements, Gap]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK019 Are assumptions about QA engine availability reflected in UX
      fallbacks when automation is offline? [Dependencies & Assumptions, Spec
      §Assumptions]
- [x] CHK020 Does the plan capture telemetry/audit dependencies that the UX must
      expose (e.g., request IDs, last run actor)? [Dependencies & Assumptions,
      Plan §Technical Context]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK021 Is the term "remediation guidance" consistently defined across
      requirements to avoid conflicting UI implementations? [Ambiguities &
      Conflicts, Spec §FR-002]
- [x] CHK022 Are definitions for "neutral" versus "warning" states aligned so
      authors and owners interpret statuses the same way? [Ambiguities &
      Conflicts, Spec §Edge Cases]
