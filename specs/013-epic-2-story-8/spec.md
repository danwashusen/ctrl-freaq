# Feature Specification: Quality Gates Integration for Document Editor

**Feature Branch**: `[013-epic-2-story-8]`  
**Created**: 2025-10-13  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Epic 2, Story 8"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-13

- Q: How do we partition access to run document-level quality gates and view
  detailed remediation data (including traceability) across roles? → A: All
  authenticated collaborators on the document can run gates and see full
  remediation detail

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Section-Level Validation Feedback (Priority: P1)

A staff engineer editing a critical section receives live quality gate feedback
that flags blockers, suggests fixes, and prevents incomplete work from moving
forward.

**Why this priority**: Section authors need immediate guidance so blocking
issues are resolved before they ripple into document approvals or exports.

**Independent Test**: Modify a section to introduce a schema violation and
confirm the editor surfaces a blocking indicator, lists actionable fixes, and
keeps the section gated until the issue is cleared.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an author is editing a section with unsaved changes, **When** they
   pause for the validation debounce window or manually trigger a check,
   **Then** the section quality gate runs within 2 seconds, shows
   Pass/Warning/Blocker status in the sidebar, and highlights each flagged rule
   inline with remediation guidance.
2. **Given** a section has an active blocker, **When** the author attempts to
   submit the section for review or include it in a bundled save, **Then** the
   system blocks the action, explains which gate failed, and offers a link to
   re-run validation after the issue is addressed.

### User Story 2 - Document Quality Gate Dashboard (Priority: P2)

A document owner preparing to publish reviews aggregated gate results across all
sections, understands outstanding blockers, and confidently holds publishing
until quality thresholds are met.

**Why this priority**: Document owners need a single readiness view to stop
non-compliant documents from reaching stakeholders.

**Independent Test**: Open a document with mixed gate outcomes, intentionally
leave one blocker unresolved, and verify the dashboard consolidates statuses,
disables publish controls, and updates once validation is re-run.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a document contains sections with mixed gate statuses, **When** the
   owner opens the quality dashboard, **Then** it summarizes blockers and
   warnings by severity, lists affected sections with shortcuts to open them,
   and keeps publish actions disabled while blockers remain.
2. **Given** the owner re-runs quality gates from the dashboard, **When** all
   sections pass, **Then** the dashboard updates within 5 seconds, clears the
   blocker count, and unlocks publish actions.

### User Story 3 - Traceability Matrix Sync (Priority: P3)

A compliance reviewer auditing coverage sees that every requirement is linked to
specific section content and the traceability matrix reflects the latest quality
gate outcomes without manual updates.

**Why this priority**: Automatic traceability ensures regulatory evidence stays
current as authors edit content.

**Independent Test**: Update a requirement-linked section, resolve validation
warnings, and confirm the traceability matrix records the new content reference,
associated gate status, and timestamp.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a section tied to one or more requirements is updated, **When**
   quality gates finish running, **Then** the traceability matrix reflects the
   new section revision, shows the latest gate result, and flags any
   requirements still missing coverage.

---

### Edge Cases

- Gate runner unavailable or times out: surface a retriable warning, log the
  failure for QA follow-up, and prevent publish until a passing run completes.
- Section created but never edited: show a neutral status and prompt the author
  to run validation before submitting the section.
- Requirement removed or reassigned: automatically orphan prior traceability
  links, notify document owners, and require reassignment before publish.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST execute section-level quality gates automatically
  after meaningful edits or on explicit user request and display pass, warning,
  or blocker status within 2 seconds of completion.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST provide inline issue details for each failed or
  warning gate, including rule description, severity, remediation guidance, and
  a control to re-run validation after changes are made. Remediation guidance
  MUST follow the structured package outlined in the UX Guidelines.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST block section submission, bundled saves, and any
  publish-enabling action while blocker-severity gates remain unresolved in the
  affected section.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST aggregate section gate results into a document
  dashboard that lists blockers, warnings, and passes by severity, identifies
  the contributing sections, and timestamps the last successful validation run.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST gate document-level publish/export actions behind
  a requirement that all sections have a passing or warning-only status and MUST
  display clear messaging when blockers remain.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST allow document owners to re-run all quality gates
  on demand from the dashboard and update aggregated results within 5 seconds of
  completion.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST maintain a traceability matrix that maps each
  documented requirement to the sections and decisions that satisfy it, updating
  links automatically whenever content or gate outcomes change.
- **FR-008**: The system MUST flag any requirement without a passing coverage
  link as a blocker, surface it in the dashboard, and prevent publish until
  coverage is restored.
- **FR-009**: The system MUST record a validation audit log capturing who ran
  the gates, when they completed, which rules failed, and the remediation status
  to support compliance reviews.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST expose quality gate status and traceability data
  to telemetry so QA teams can monitor run frequency, failure rates, and time to
  resolution.
- **FR-011**: The system MUST permit every authenticated collaborator with
  access to the document to trigger quality gates and review full remediation
  and traceability details, regardless of role.

### UX Guidelines

- **Status Vocabulary Alignment**: All quality-gate indicators across the
  section sidebar, inline callouts, dashboard tables, and traceability matrix
  MUST use the shared labels `Pass`, `Warning`, `Blocker`, and `Neutral`.
  Display them with consistent iconography (solid green dot, amber triangle, red
  stop icon, muted gray circle respectively) and apply the same color tokens in
  every surface so authors and owners interpret statuses uniformly.
- **Validation Progress Messaging**: During the <2 second debounce window, show
  a sidebar progress chip with copy `Validating section…` and an animated
  progress ring. If validation exceeds 2 seconds, switch to
  `Still checking—this may take another moment` while leaving the ring active.
  Manual re-runs use the same affordance and frame the action as
  `Re-run validation` directly adjacent to the status chip.
- **Remediation Guidance Package Definition**: Each failed or warning rule MUST
  render remediation guidance as a mini-card containing (1) a severity badge,
  (2) a one-sentence rule summary, (3) a bulleted list of concrete fix steps or
  links, and (4) an optional `View policy` link when deeper documentation is
  available.
- **Publish Blocking Copy**: When blockers exist, disable publish/export buttons
  and display inline helper text reading
  `Publishing blocked: resolve X blocker issues first` with a link to the
  dashboard. When blockers clear, replace the helper text with
  `All sections ready—publishing enabled`.
- **Traceability Matrix Presentation**: Each requirement row MUST include a
  two-line content preview (first 180 characters of the linked section), a
  status badge using the shared vocabulary, and the `Last validated` timestamp.
  Provide filter chips for `Blockers`, `Warnings`, `Neutral/Not Run`, and
  `Covered` so reviewers can prioritize multiple requirements per section.
- **Runner Failure & Retry UX**: If the gate runner times out or is unavailable,
  surface a warning toast reading
  `Validation paused—service unavailable. Try again or contact QA.` Provide a
  persistent `Retry validation` button and log the incident ID in the dashboard
  footer for follow-up.
- **Neutral State Treatment**: Sections that have never completed validation
  display the muted gray circle with tooltip copy `Validation not run yet`.
  Prompt authors with a `Run validation` link inline with the tooltip.
- **Orphaned Requirement Notices**: When requirements lose coverage, show a
  high-urgency banner at the top of the dashboard:
  `Traceability gap detected: 3 requirements need reassignment.` Include quick
  links to affected rows and a `Resolve now` call-to-action for document owners.
- **Accessibility Expectations**: Validation status updates MUST announce via an
  ARIA live region, focus order MUST move to the newest blocker row after a run,
  and all color indicators MUST meet WCAG AA contrast with their backgrounds.
- **Localization & Terminology**: Status labels, remediation text, and helper
  copy MUST use strings managed in the shared `doc-quality` i18n namespace.
  Provide locale-neutral tokens so translations preserve terminology
  consistency.
- **Telemetry & Audit Surface**: The dashboard footer MUST expose `Last run by`,
  `Completed at`, and the validation `Request ID`, mirroring the audit log so QA
  teams can reconcile telemetry without opening separate tools.
- **Clarity Survey Artefacts**: UX deliverables MUST include the helper copy and
  remediation card designs in the research prototype used to evaluate SC-005,
  ensuring survey responses tie to specific UI guidance.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **SectionQualityGateResult**: Represents the latest validation outcome for a
  section, including status (pass, warning, blocker), evaluated rules with
  severity, remediation guidance, and timestamps for last run and last success.
- **DocumentQualityGateSummary**: Aggregates per-section results into document
  readiness data, tracking blocker counts, warning counts, last run metadata,
  and the identity of the user who triggered the latest run.
- **TraceabilityLink**: Maps a requirement or policy item to the section content
  and gate result that satisfy it, recording coverage status, supporting notes,
  and audit history when requirements are reassigned or removed.

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of section-level validation runs display updated status within
  2 seconds of an edit pause or manual trigger during beta testing.
- **SC-002**: 100% of publish attempts on documents with blocker-level issues
  are prevented until all blockers are cleared, as verified by end-to-end
  regression tests.
- **SC-003**: The document dashboard reflects re-run results within 5 seconds in
  98% of test runs, ensuring owners can make real-time decisions.
- **SC-004**: The traceability matrix maintains up-to-date links for 100% of
  requirements touched during testing, with no stale references detected across
  weekly audits.
- **SC-005**: At least 90% of pilot authors report that the quality gate
  feedback is clear and actionable (Likert score ≥4) in post-session surveys.

## Assumptions

- Quality gate definitions and execution engines from the QA package remain the
  source of truth; this feature orchestrates running them and presenting
  results.
- Validation can reuse the existing bundled save debounce window for automatic
  runs without introducing additional server load.
- Document owners retain authority to decide when warnings (non-blockers) are
  acceptable; blockers always halt publish until resolved.
- Requirements catalog and section metadata already exist so the traceability
  matrix can link identifiers without new schema changes.
