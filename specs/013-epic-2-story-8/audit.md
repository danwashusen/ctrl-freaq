# Code Review Report: Quality Gates Integration for Document Editor (013-epic-2-story-8)

## Final Status: **Approved**

## Resolved Scope

**Branch**: `013-epic-2-story-8` **Baseline**: `main` **Diff Source**: `HEAD` vs
`main` **Review Target**: End-to-end quality gate orchestration across shared
libraries, API routes, persistence, telemetry, and the document editor
experience **Files Analyzed**: 38 changed / new files spanning API modules,
shared libraries, the QA package, React UI, fixtures, tests, and feature docs

**Resolved Scope Narrative**: Audited the new quality gate stack: shared models
and repositories, QA runner orchestration, Express controllers/routes,
traceability services, CLI entry points, React stores/components, telemetry
hooks, fixtures, Vitest/Playwright suites, and supporting spec documentation.
Confirmed integration from persistence through UI, telemetry, and contract
coverage.

## Findings

### Active Findings (Current Iteration)

None.

### Historical Findings Log

- [Resolved 2025-10-16] F001: Section quality runner never evaluates QA rules —
  Reported 2025-10-14 by Codex Code Review (autonomous). Resolution: Runner now
  loads section content, executes rule catalog, and persists severities
  (`apps/api/src/services/container.ts:333-387`,
  `packages/qa/src/gates/section/section-quality-runner.ts`). Evidence:
  `apps/api/tests/contract/quality-gates/sections.contract.test.ts` verifies
  blocker/warning propagation.
- [Resolved 2025-10-16] F002: Traceability sync stores run IDs instead of
  section revisions — Reported 2025-10-14 by Codex Code Review (autonomous).
  Resolution: Section revisions derived from `approvedVersion`/`updatedAt`;
  traceability sync persists revision IDs distinct from `runId`
  (`apps/api/src/services/container.ts:402-429`,
  `packages/qa/src/traceability/traceability-sync.ts:101-145`). Evidence:
  `apps/api/tests/contract/quality-gates/traceability.contract.test.ts` asserts
  stored revision format.
- [Resolved 2025-10-16] F003: Document summary ignores traceability coverage
  gaps — Reported 2025-10-14 by Codex Code Review (autonomous). Resolution:
  Coverage resolver aggregates gaps from traceability links and feeds dashboard
  summary (`apps/api/src/services/container.ts:448-531`,
  `packages/qa/src/dashboard/document-quality-summary.ts`). Evidence:
  `apps/api/tests/contract/quality-gates/documents.contract.test.ts` blocks
  publish until gaps addressed.
- [Resolved 2025-10-16] F004: Section run API deviates from published contracts
  — Reported 2025-10-14 by Codex Code Review (autonomous). Resolution: Express
  controllers align with OpenAPI, returning structured acknowledgements and
  latest results
  (`apps/api/src/modules/quality-gates/controllers/section-quality.controller.ts`).
  Evidence: `apps/api/tests/contract/quality-gates/sections.contract.test.ts`
  exercises POST/GET flows against contract.

## Strengths

- Clean dependency injection for quality gates: container wiring hydrates
  runner, audit logging, telemetry, and traceability sync in a single
  registration, keeping cross-cutting concerns centralized
  (`apps/api/src/services/container.ts:333-532`).
- React stores encapsulate SLA messaging, publish gating, and remediation state
  with translator-driven copy, simplifying components and ensuring consistent UX
  (`apps/web/src/features/document-editor/quality-gates/stores/{section-quality-store.ts,document-quality-store.ts}`).
- Document Quality Dashboard stitches telemetry, coverage gaps, and traceability
  filters into an accessible control surface, complete with Playwright coverage
  for SLA + metrics
  (`apps/web/src/features/document-editor/quality-gates/components/DocumentQualityDashboard.tsx`,
  `apps/web/tests/e2e/document-editor/quality-gates-dashboard-sla.e2e.ts`).

## Outstanding Clarifications

| ----------------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Constitutional Principles** | Pass          | Library-first architecture preserved; CLI exposed; tests authored across layers. |
| **SOC 2 Authentication**      | Pass          | All new endpoints sit behind existing Clerk/test-auth middleware.                |
| **SOC 2 Logging**             | Pass          | Audit logger emits structured queue/completion/failure events with request IDs.  |
| **Security Controls**         | Pass (manual) | No new surface bypasses; controllers validate auth and handle 401/403/503 paths. |
| **Code Quality**              | Pass          | Typecheck + targeted tests clean; prior findings resolved.                       |
| **Testing Requirements**      | Pass          | Contract, unit, and UI tests cover new behavior; Playwright fixtures authored.   |

## Decision Log

- 2025-10-16: Verified quality gate migrations execute via automated Vitest runs
  (`apps/api` test logs) ensuring shared-data schemas present before assertions.
- 2025-10-16: Confirmed prior findings F001–F004 resolved through new
  orchestration, traceability revisions, coverage resolver, and contract
  alignment (see Historical Findings).
- 2025-10-16: Recorded that Playwright suites exist for SLA/telemetry but were
  not run in the local audit environment; recommend CI verification.

## Remediation Logging

No remediation tasks required (no active findings).
