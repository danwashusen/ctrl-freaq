# Feature Specification: New Section Content Flow

**Feature Branch**: `009-epic-2-story-4`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Epic 2, Story 4"

## Execution Flow (main)

1. User chooses a section that has no approved content. → System confirms the
   section context and opens the "Start new content" flow.
2. System presents a prioritized assumptions checklist sourced from the section
   template and recent document activity. → User answers, defers, escalates, or
   explicitly skips into drafting; any skip records an override and warns that
   submission remains blocked until prompts are resolved.
3. When prompts reference document-level decisions, the system surfaces the
   prior answer and asks the user to reconcile any conflicts. → Conflicting
   responses are blocked until the user revises their section-level answer to
   align with the document-level decision.
4. System summarises captured assumptions and highlights open risks. → User
   reviews, edits, or requests clarification before drafting begins.
5. User confirms the prepared assumptions. → System generates a first-draft
   proposal with rationale tied to each assumption, keeping the section in a
   dedicated drafting workspace.
6. User reviews the proposed draft, edits content, or reopens the assumptions
   loop before finalising or abandoning the draft. → Every proposal generated
   during the session remains available for comparison, and on final
   confirmation the section transitions into the standard drafting lifecycle for
   review and approval only if all assumption overrides have been reconciled.

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- Keep assumption discovery mandatory before any blank section enters drafting.
- Present rationale and decision audit trails in business language the reviewer
  can reference later.
- Preserve the human-in-control posture: every AI suggestion remains optional
  and requires explicit confirmation.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29

- Q: When a section is blank, how should the New Section Content Flow handle
  attempts to bypass the assumptions checklist before drafting? → A: User may
  skip to drafting, but the system records an override and blocks submission
  until prompts are resolved.
- Q: When a section-level assumption conflicts with an existing document-level
  decision, what resolution path should the system enforce before drafting can
  continue? → A: User must revise the section-level response to match the
  document-level decision before proceeding.
- Q: For each assumption session, how should draft proposals be retained? → A:
  Keep every proposal generated within the session so reviewers can compare
  versions later.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A staff engineer opens a blank architecture section, works through the
assumption checklist, receives an AI-generated first draft with rationale, and
adjusts the copy before sending the section into the normal review flow.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a section has no approved content, **When** the user selects "Start
   new content", **Then** the system displays a prioritized assumptions
   checklist with progress indicators, allows an explicit skip into drafting
   only by recording an override, and blocks the section from final submission
   until every prompt is answered, deferred, or escalated.
2. **Given** the user completes the assumption prompts, **When** the system
   detects a response that conflicts with a document-level decision, **Then** it
   flags the conflict, explains the prior decision, and blocks progress until
   the user revises the section response to match the documented decision.
3. **Given** the user confirms the assumption summary, **When** the system
   generates the first draft, **Then** it presents the proposed copy alongside a
   rationale table mapping each paragraph to the underlying assumptions, keeps
   every proposal produced in the session available for comparison, and allows
   the user to edit or reopen the assumption flow before saving.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user exits the flow mid-assumption and later returns to
  the section—does the system resume where they left off or restart the
  checklist?
- How does the system handle a prompt that the user flags as "needs input from
  another stakeholder"—does the section remain blocked, or can it progress with
  a placeholder?
- What feedback appears if AI drafting fails or returns low-confidence content
  so the user knows whether to retry, edit manually, or request clarification?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST recognise when a section lacks approved content
  and offer the New Section Content Flow as the primary entry point.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST present a prioritized list of section-specific
  assumptions sourced from the governing template and recent document context,
  capturing an explicit user decision for each item and, when a user skips into
  drafting, recording an override that blocks final submission until all prompts
  are resolved.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST highlight conflicts between section-level
  responses and document-level decisions and block drafting until the user
  revises their answer to align with the documented decision (or the
  document-level decision is updated upstream).
- **FR-004**: The system MUST produce an assumption summary that records the
  selected answers, outstanding risks, and any escalations for later review.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST generate an initial draft proposal that cites the
  relevant assumptions for each major content block and allows the user to edit
  before saving.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST let users reopen the assumptions checklist from
  the draft review screen so they can adjust earlier answers without abandoning
  their in-progress copy.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST persist the assumption decisions, every draft
  proposal generated during the session, and the draft rationale within the
  section history so reviewers understand how the content was produced.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Section Assumption**: A structured prompt tied to the section template that
  records the user-selected answer, supporting context, and reconciliation
  status versus document-level decisions.
- **Assumption Session**: A single run of the New Section Content Flow capturing
  timestamps, participants, decisions, unresolved items, and links to generated
  drafts.
- **Draft Proposal**: The first-pass content produced from a completed
  assumption session, including rationale annotations that trace output to
  assumptions and outstanding risks.
