# Feature Specification: CI Pipeline Setup

**Feature Branch**: `003-1-2-ci`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Epic 1, Story 2 - CI Pipeline Setup"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Epic 1, Story 2 identified from PRD
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: GitHub Actions, PR/main branches, monorepo testing, build status
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Marked Node.js version preference
   � Marked visual testing inclusion
   � Marked caching strategy
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � CI workflow triggers and validation paths defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement maps to PRD acceptance criteria
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Workflow configurations and job definitions
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer on the CTRL FreaQ team, I need automated continuous integration that validates my code changes before merging, ensuring all packages in our monorepo pass quality checks and preventing broken code from reaching the main branch.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer pushes code to a pull request branch, **When** the push completes, **Then** the CI pipeline automatically starts running lint, type-check, and build jobs
2. **Given** all CI jobs have completed, **When** all jobs pass successfully, **Then** the PR shows a green status check allowing merge
3. **Given** a CI job fails, **When** viewing the PR, **Then** the failed job is clearly indicated with access to error logs
4. **Given** code is merged to main branch, **When** the merge completes, **Then** the CI pipeline runs to verify main branch integrity
5. **Given** a CI run completes, **When** viewing the workflow summary, **Then** execution metrics (duration, warnings) are visible

### Edge Cases
- What happens when CI runs exceed 5 minute time limit?
- How does system handle concurrent CI runs on the same PR?
- What happens if GitHub Actions service is unavailable?
- How are flaky tests handled in the CI pipeline?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST automatically trigger CI workflow on every pull request creation and update
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically trigger CI workflow on every push to main branch
- **FR-003**: CI pipeline MUST run lint checks across all packages in the monorepo
- **FR-004**: CI pipeline MUST run TypeScript type checking across all packages
- **FR-005**: CI pipeline MUST build all packages successfully before passing
- **FR-006**: System MUST require all CI status checks to pass before allowing PR merge
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate workflow artifacts containing execution metrics (duration, warning count)
- **FR-008**: CI pipeline MUST fail fast on first error to minimize resource usage
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear error messages and logs for debugging failed jobs
- **FR-010**: CI pipeline MUST validate monorepo workspace integrity including dependency version consistency checks
- **FR-011**: System MUST run tests if present (visual regression tests excluded from MVP)
- **FR-012**: CI pipeline MUST use Node.js 20.x runtime
- **FR-013**: System SHOULD cache pnpm store between runs for improved performance

### Key Entities
- **CI Workflow**: Automated pipeline configuration that defines when and how quality checks run
- **Status Check**: Pass/fail indicator for each CI job that determines merge eligibility
- **Workflow Artifact**: Summary report containing metrics and logs from CI execution
- **Job**: Individual task within the workflow (lint, type-check, build, test)

## Context from Primary Sources

### PRD Requirements (Epic 1, Story 2)
The CI Pipeline Setup story establishes automated quality assurance for the monorepo, ensuring code quality and preventing regressions. This directly supports the Constitutional requirement for test infrastructure and the broader goal of maintaining high-quality, AI-optimized documentation generation capabilities.

### Integration with Testing Strategy
The front-end specification emphasizes automated testing integration within CI/CD pipelines, including accessibility testing and potentially visual regression testing. This ensures the UI maintains quality standards as the document editor evolves.

### Resolved Decisions
1. **Node.js Version**: CI will use Node.js 20.x for stability
2. **Visual Testing**: Visual regression tests excluded from MVP, deferred to post-MVP
3. **Dependency Caching**: Cache pnpm store only (not node_modules) for balanced performance
4. **Workflow Timeout**: 5 minute maximum duration before automatic termination
5. **Workspace Validation**: Include dependency version consistency checks

### Remaining Open Questions
1. **Test Coverage**: Minimum coverage thresholds to enforce?
