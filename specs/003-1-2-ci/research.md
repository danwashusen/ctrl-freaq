# Research Findings: CI Pipeline Setup

## Executive Summary
This document consolidates research findings for implementing GitHub Actions CI pipeline for the CTRL FreaQ monorepo. All clarification questions from the specification have been resolved through stakeholder input.

## Resolved Decisions

### 1. Node.js Version Strategy
**Decision**: Use Node.js 20.x LTS
**Rationale**:
- Provides stability for CI environment
- Matches development environment per architecture.md
- LTS ensures long-term support and security updates
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Latest Node.js: Rejected due to potential breaking changes
- Node.js 18.x: Rejected as project uses 20.x features

### 2. Visual Testing Inclusion
**Decision**: Exclude visual regression tests from MVP
**Rationale**:
- Reduces CI complexity for initial implementation
- Speeds up CI execution time
- Can be added post-MVP when UI stabilizes
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Include Playwright visual tests: Deferred to post-MVP
- Screenshot-only tests: Insufficient value for MVP phase

### 3. Dependency Caching Strategy
**Decision**: Cache pnpm store only
**Rationale**:
- Optimal balance between speed and cache size
- pnpm's content-addressable store is efficient
- Avoids node_modules duplication across packages
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Cache both pnpm store and node_modules: Excessive cache size
- No caching: Too slow for developer experience

### 4. Workflow Timeout
**Decision**: 5-minute maximum duration
**Rationale**:
- Prevents runaway jobs consuming resources
- Forces optimization of slow tests
- Aligns with fast feedback goals
**Alternatives Considered**:
- 10 minutes: Too lenient for MVP scope
- 3 minutes: Too restrictive for full build

### 5. Workspace Validation Scope
**Decision**: Include dependency version consistency checks
**Rationale**:
- Prevents version conflicts in monorepo
- Ensures all packages use same major versions
- Catches issues before runtime
**Alternatives Considered**:
- Basic structure validation only: Insufficient for monorepo health
- Full dependency graph analysis: Over-engineered for MVP

## GitHub Actions Best Practices

### Monorepo Optimization
1. **Turborepo Integration**:
   - Use `turbo run` commands for parallelization
   - Leverage Turborepo's dependency graph
   - Enable remote caching in future phases

2. **pnpm Workspace Commands**:
   - Use `pnpm -r` for recursive operations
   - Filter commands with `--filter` for targeted runs
   - Utilize pnpm's built-in parallelization

### Performance Optimization
1. **Job Parallelization**:
   - Run lint, typecheck, and test in parallel
   - Use job matrix for package-level parallelization
   - Fail fast on first error

2. **Caching Strategy**:
   ```yaml
   - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
     with:
       node-version: '20'
       cache: 'pnpm'
   ```

3. **Conditional Execution**:
   - Skip unchanged packages using Turborepo
   - Cancel previous runs on same PR
   - Use path filters for targeted workflows

### Security Considerations
1. **Permissions**:
   - Use least-privilege principle
   - Explicitly declare required permissions
   - Restrict secret access

2. **Dependency Management**:
   - Pin action versions to SHA
   - Regular Dependabot updates
   - Audit dependencies in CI

## Implementation Approach

### Workflow Structure
```
.github/workflows/
├── ci.yml              # Main CI pipeline
├── pr-validation.yml   # PR-specific checks
└── reusable/          # Shared workflow components
    ├── setup.yml      # Common setup steps
    └── cache.yml      # Caching configuration
```

### Job Architecture
1. **Setup Job**: Install dependencies, setup caching
2. **Quality Jobs** (parallel):
   - Lint: ESLint across all packages
   - Typecheck: TypeScript compilation
   - Format: Prettier validation
3. **Build Job**: Build all packages
4. **Test Job**: Run test suites
5. **Metrics Job**: Generate and upload artifacts

### Status Check Configuration
- Required checks: lint, typecheck, build, test
- Optional checks: format, metrics
- Branch protection: enforce on main

## Metrics and Observability

### Workflow Artifacts
1. **Execution Metrics**:
   - Job duration per package
   - Warning counts
   - Test coverage (if available)

2. **Build Artifacts**:
   - Build outputs for debugging
   - Log files for failed jobs
   - Performance profiling data

### Monitoring Approach
- GitHub Actions dashboard for trends
- Slack notifications for failures (future)
- Weekly CI performance reports (future)

## Migration Path
For existing projects adopting this CI:
1. Start with basic workflow
2. Add checks incrementally
3. Enable branch protection gradually
4. Monitor and optimize based on metrics
