# Feature Specification: Section Draft Persistence

**Feature Branch**: `[010-epic-2-story-5]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-30  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Epic 2, Story 5"

## Execution Flow (main)

1. Authenticated authors open an architecture document from the dashboard.
2. Entering edit mode on any section captures the current published content as
   the baseline for comparison.
3. As edits occur, the editor retains an up-to-date local draft for that section
   without interrupting the writing flow.
4. Drafts persist through navigation, refresh, and transient connectivity loss,
   remaining scoped to the signed-in user and project.
5. Choosing Save validates every section carrying unsaved work, packages those
   updates into one submission, and applies confirmed changes to the server
   document.
6. Reloading the document rehydrates any remaining drafts, surfaces choices to
   apply or discard them, and only merges server updates after the user
   confirms.
7. Signing out clears every locally stored draft before ending the session so no
   client data persists across accounts.

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- Preserve trust: never discard unsaved work without explicit confirmation.
- Mirror status cues defined in
  `/docs/front-end-spec.md#core-document-editor-workflow` so authors recognize
  sections holding drafts.
- Keep recovery frictionless: reopening the browser or switching devices should
  present the same draft state once the user signs back in.

### Section Requirements

- Mandatory coverage: section editing, multi-section save, draft recovery, and
  failure messaging.
- Optional enhancements (analytics, collaboration signals, automation) are
  explicitly out of scope for this story.

### For AI Generation

1. AI proposals must respect the active draft content for a section and base
   suggestions on the latest author edits.
2. Do not auto-apply AI changes; every application must flow through the user
   approval and quality gates already defined in
   `/docs/prd.md#epic-2-details-document-editor-core`.
3. Validation messaging should reinforce how drafts are protected when services
   degrade, aligning with the guardrails in the constitution.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30

- Q: When a recovered draft conflicts with newer server updates, how should the
  editor resolve the conflicting sections before save? → A: Keep local draft
  primary and archive the server version for replay.
- Q: If local draft storage reaches its capacity before the author saves, what
  should the editor do? → A: Automatically prune oldest drafts and notify the
  user.
- Q: How long should the system keep unsaved drafts before auto-expiring them if
  the author takes no action? → A: Keep drafts until the author discards them.
- Q: If the bundled save fails validation for a single section, how should the
  editor respond while preserving other sections’ drafts? → A: Abort entire save
  and require retry after fixes.
- Q: Where must unsaved drafts be stored to satisfy security expectations for
  this feature? → A: Keep drafts client-side only and clear on logout.
- Q: When drafts are saved or auto-pruned, what telemetry must the system
  capture to satisfy observability requirements? → A: Keep telemetry client-side
  only for debugging.
- Q: What is the expected maximum time for the editor to rehydrate all local
  drafts after the author reloads the document? → A: Complete rehydration within
  about 3 seconds on local hardware; if slower, surface guidance explaining the
  delay.
- Q: What is the maximum aggregate size of unsaved drafts per document before
  pruning starts? → A: Rely on the browser storage limit with no explicit cap.
- Q: How should the system uniquely identify each section draft so it stays
  distinct across projects and documents? → A: Use document slug plus section
  title per author.
- Q: How should draft status indicators communicate their state to meet
  accessibility expectations? → A: Use visible text labels and ARIA live
  announcements for changes.
- Q: When offline edits collide with a project retention policy that requires
  server-side backups, how should compliance be satisfied? → A: Log a compliance
  warning and allow manual escalation later.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A staff engineer updating several architecture sections expects in-progress
edits to persist across sessions until every change is reviewed and saved.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an author edits multiple sections and sees draft indicators,
   **When** they choose Save, **Then** the system bundles all pending sections
   into one validation run, applies approved changes together, and clears the
   indicators.
2. **Given** an author has unsaved work and closes the browser, **When** they
   reopen the document, **Then** the editor restores each draft in place and
   prompts for review before any server content overwrites it.
3. **Given** an author resumes editing while offline, **When** connectivity is
   restored, **Then** the editor keeps the draft intact, flags any conflicts
   with the server version, and asks the user how to proceed.

### Edge Cases

- When browser storage capacity is exhausted before save, the editor prunes the
  oldest drafts automatically, explains that the cap comes from the browser
  limit, and alerts the user before continuing edits.
- When drafts conflict with newer server updates, keep the local draft primary,
  archive the server version for later review, and prompt the author to merge
  before saving.
- Drafts remain available indefinitely until the author explicitly discards or
  saves them.
- If validation fails for one section, abort the bundled save, preserve all
  drafts, and guide the author to resolve the flagged issues before retrying.
- Logging out must purge local drafts immediately and confirm the clearance
  before redirecting.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST persist unsaved section edits for the signed-in user
  until they are saved or explicitly discarded.
- **FR-002**: System MUST display per-section draft status, including last
  updated timestamp, and expose an explicit revert-to-published control before
  saving.
- **FR-002a**: System MUST expose draft status through visible text labels and
  announce status changes via ARIA live regions to remain accessible.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow authors to navigate away from editing (including
  closing the browser or timing out) without losing draft content.
- **FR-004**: System MUST bundle every section carrying a draft into a single
  save action that validates quality gates and communicates success or failure
  per section.
- **FR-005**: System MUST restore outstanding drafts on reload and prompt users
  to apply or discard them before incorporating remote updates.
- **FR-006**: System MUST record who created or updated each draft, retire the
  local copy once the server confirms acceptance, and emit audit metadata
  (author, timestamp) for compliance logs.
- **FR-007**: System MUST prioritize the author's local draft when server
  updates conflict, archiving the server version for later reapplication and
  presenting both during resolution.
- **FR-008**: System MUST prune the oldest stored drafts and notify the author
  when the browser storage limit is reached so editing can continue without data
  loss.
- **FR-009**: System MUST retain unsaved drafts indefinitely until the author
  saves or discards them, ensuring no automatic expiration removes work.
- **FR-010**: System MUST abort the entire bundled save when any section fails
  validation, keeping all drafts intact and presenting targeted guidance before
  the user retries.
- **FR-011**: System MUST keep unsaved drafts entirely on the client and clear
  them immediately during logout to maintain author-only access.
- **FR-012**: System MUST expose client-side telemetry for draft persistence
  events in the browser developer console without transmitting content or
  identifiers to the server.
- **FR-013**: System MUST key each section draft using document slug, section
  title, and author identity to prevent collisions across projects.
- **FR-014**: System MUST log a compliance warning when retention policies
  require server backups yet drafts remain client-only, enabling manual
  escalation without auto-syncing content.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Document Draft State**: Aggregates every section with unsaved work for a
  given document, tracking user, timestamps, and overall save readiness.
- **Section Draft**: Represents a single section's local edits, keyed by
  document slug + section title per author, including the baseline version
  reference and any notes captured during review.
- **Save Submission**: The packaged payload containing all draft sections,
  validation results, and messaging shown to the user after completion.

### Non-Functional Considerations

- Draft rehydration should complete within ~3 seconds on local hardware; if that
  threshold cannot be met, surface guidance while still prioritizing reliability
  over strict latency SLAs.
