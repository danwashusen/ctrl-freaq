# Code Review Report: Section Draft Persistence (010-epic-2-story-5)

## Final Status: **Changes Requested**

## Resolved Scope

**Branch**: `010-epic-2-story-5` **Baseline**: `main` **Diff Source**:
`git diff main...HEAD` **Review Target**: Section Draft Persistence **Files
Analyzed**: 32 changed files covering backend draft APIs, shared persistence
library updates, frontend draft UX wiring, QA helpers, and regression tests

**Resolved Scope Narrative**: Audited the expanded draft persistence pipeline
from the shared `@ctrl-freaq/editor-persistence` store through new Express draft
bundle/compliance endpoints, front-end draft indicators/logout hooks, QA logging
helpers, and the Vitest/Playwright coverage that exercises quota pruning and
logout flows.

**Feature Directory**: `specs/010-epic-2-story-5` **Implementation Scope**:

- DraftStore enhancements for composite keys, quota pruning, and logout purge
- Draft bundle repository/service wiring plus compliance logging endpoints in
  `apps/api`
- QA compliance helper for retention warnings in `packages/qa`
- React hook + badge UX for section-level draft status and revert controls
- Clerk `UserButton` wrapper and logout registry bridge for clearing DraftStore
- Vitest + Playwright suites validating draft storage, pruning, and logout flows

## Findings

### Finding F5: Section draft badges misreport drafts when other sections have saves

- **Category**: Functional Correctness
- **Severity**: Major
- **Confidence**: High
- **Impact**: `useDraftPersistence` marks every section within a document as
  “Draft pending” whenever _any_ draft exists for that author/document, because
  the rehydration branch only checks `state.sections.length > 0` and never
  verifies the current `draftKey`. Authors lose the ability to identify which
  sections hold unsaved edits, undermining FR-002 and creating risk of
  unnecessary revert/discard actions.
- **Evidence**:
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/use-draft-persistence.ts:60-82`
  sets the status solely on the presence of any draft in the document, without
  filtering for the current section key.
- **Remediation**: Filter the rehydrated `sections` to locate the matching
  `draftKey`/`sectionPath` before marking the badge as pending, and reset the
  status to “Synced” when no entry exists for the current section. Update unit
  or Playwright coverage to assert per-section isolation.
- **Source Requirement**: FR-002 (per-section draft status + accessibility)
- **Files**:
  apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/use-draft-persistence.ts:60

### Finding F6: Draft bundle/compliance APIs trust client-supplied author identity

- **Category**: Security & Privacy
- **Severity**: Major
- **Confidence**: High
- **Impact**: The new PATCH/POST routes accept `submittedBy` and `authorId`
  directly from the request body and forward them into audit logs and service
  logic without cross-checking the authenticated user. A malicious client can
  spoof another author, pollute audit trails, and bypass FR-006’s “emit audit
  metadata (author, timestamp)” guarantee. Violates Constitution security rules
  around authentication/authorization.
- **Evidence**: `apps/api/src/routes/documents.ts:152-213` delegates the
  body-provided identifiers to `DraftBundleService` and compliance logging
  without validating against `req.auth?.userId`.
- **Remediation**: Derive the author identity from the authenticated Clerk
  session (`req.auth.userId`), reject or log discrepancies, and update tests to
  assert impersonation is blocked.
- **Source Requirement**: CONSTITUTION.md (Security - authentication & audit)
- **Files**: apps/api/src/routes/documents.ts:152-213

### Finding F7: Lint gate still emits warnings

- **Category**: Maintainability / Quality Controls
- **Severity**: Minor
- **Confidence**: High
- **Impact**: `pnpm test:ci` logs ESLint warnings for missing effect
  dependencies and forbidden non-null assertions. Leaving warnings in the
  primary gate erodes the Constitution’s “Quality Controls Protection” standard
  and risks future regressions slipping through.
- **Evidence**: `pnpm test:ci` output flags `DraftStatusBadge.tsx:37` and
  `draft-logout-registry.ts:44,65`.
- **Remediation**: Destructure props to add the needed dependencies and replace
  the `!` assertions with explicit guards so ESLint runs cleanly.
- **Source Requirement**: Constitution §Quality Controls Protection
- **Files**:
  apps/web/src/features/document-editor/components/section-draft/DraftStatusBadge.tsx:37;
  apps/web/src/lib/draft-logout-registry.ts:44,65

## Strengths

- Comprehensive Vitest coverage for `createDraftStore`, including quota pruning
  and logout purge scenarios.
- Playwright E2E suite now exercises quota banners and the new logout bridge,
  keeping regression guardrails high.
- Backend repository/service split cleanly applies JSON patches and emits audit
  metadata with structured logging.

## Outstanding Clarifications

None.

## Decision Log

- `.specify/scripts/bash/check-implementation-prerequisites.sh` missing in repo;
  proceeded after recording the gap.
- Ran `pnpm test:ci` (76.9s) locally—lint/typecheck/test phases complete with
  zero failures but 3 lint warnings.
- Reran `pnpm test:ci` after F5–F7 remediation (2025-09-30) confirming clean
  lint/typecheck/test/Playwright signals.

## Remediation Logging

### Remediation R5

- **Context**: Draft badges misidentify sections with drafts (Finding F5)
- **Control Reference**: FR-002 (per-section status & accessibility)
- **Actions**: Filter rehydrated results by the current `draftKey`, update
  status/ARIA state accordingly, and extend tests to cover mixed-section
  scenarios.
- **Verification**: Added unit coverage ensuring only targeted sections show
  “Draft pending” and reran `pnpm test:ci` (2025-09-30) with a passing result.

### Remediation R6

- **Context**: Draft bundle/compliance endpoints accept spoofed author IDs
  (Finding F6)
- **Control Reference**: Constitution Security rules; FR-006 audit metadata
- **Actions**: Use `req.auth.userId` as the authoritative author ID, reject
  mismatches, and update contract/unit tests for negative cases.
- **Verification**: Added contract tests covering impersonation attempts and
  reran `pnpm test:ci` (2025-09-30) with a passing result.

**Review Completed**: 2025-09-30 **Reviewer**: Claude Code Review v2.0 **Next
