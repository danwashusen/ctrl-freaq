# Tasks: Project Lifecycle Management

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/016-a-user-should-be-able/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Required (Constitution mandates TDD). Write failing tests before
implementation within each story phase.

**Organization**: Tasks grouped by user story to enable independent
implementation and testing.

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Confirm local workspace and tooling ready to exercise lifecycle
changes.

- [x] T001 [Setup] Verify workspace dependencies with `pnpm install` and
      document any missing env variables in
      `/specs/016-a-user-should-be-able/quickstart.md`.
- [x] T002 [P] [Setup] Validate API and web environment configs
      (`AUTH_PROVIDER`, `VITE_API_BASE_URL`) in `/apps/api/.env.local` and
      `/apps/web/.env.local`, updating quickstart notes if adjustments are
      required.
- [x] T003 [P] [Setup] Smoke start dev servers
      (`timeout 10 pnpm --filter @ctrl-freaq/api dev`,
      `pnpm --filter @ctrl-freaq/web dev:e2e`) to ensure baseline stack is
      healthy before feature work.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Extend shared data layer to support lifecycle metadata for all
subsequent stories. ‚ö†Ô∏è Complete before beginning any user story.

- [x] T004 [Foundation] Create failing lifecycle schema tests in
      `/packages/shared-data/tests/project.lifecycle.test.ts` covering status,
      visibility, goal fields, and soft-delete behaviour.
- [x] T005 [Foundation] Update `/packages/shared-data/src/models/project.ts` to
      add lifecycle fields, remove single-project guardrails, and expose helper
      methods for archive/restore per research decisions D001‚ÄìD006.
- [x] T006 [Foundation] Add forward/backward-safe migration in
      `/packages/shared-data/src/migrations/20251025_project_lifecycle.ts` and
      register it in `/packages/shared-data/src/migrations/index.ts`.
- [x] T007 [P] [Foundation] Extend `/packages/shared-data/src/cli.ts` with
      project lifecycle subcommands (list statuses, archive, restore) to
      maintain CLI parity.

**Checkpoint**: Shared data layer supports new lifecycle metadata; migrations
applied successfully.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 ‚Äì Create a new project from the dashboard (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Authenticated users can create projects with lifecycle metadata
directly from the dashboard.

      `/apps/web/src/lib/api-context.tsx`) with typed create mutation supporting
      visibility/goal fields.
- [x] T013 [US1] Introduce reusable create dialog component at
      `/apps/web/src/components/projects/CreateProjectDialog.tsx` with
      validation aligned to spec FR-001/002.

      `/apps/web/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` to open dialog, submit mutation, and
      invalidate project queries on success.

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 complete‚Äîproject creation works end-to-end with
tests passing.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 ‚Äì Review project summaries on the dashboard (Priority: P2)

- [x] T041 [P] [US2] Add regression test (component or Playwright) ensuring
      dashboard preserves existing list data and surfaces retry messaging when
      project fetch fails.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T018 [US2] Update list handler in `/apps/api/src/routes/projects.ts` to
      support pagination, include lifecycle fields, and optionally include
      archived projects.
- [x] T019 [US2] Introduce projects query hook
      (`/apps/web/src/hooks/use-projects-query.ts`) backed by TanStack Query
      with background refetch logic.

      restore them after returning from project detail to satisfy FR-005.
- [x] T042 [US2] Implement resilient error handling on dashboard fetch failures
      (retain prior list snapshot, show inline retry) per edge-case expectation.

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 + 2 deliverable independently testable; dashboard
reflects multiple projects accurately.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 ‚Äì Update an existing project (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Authorized users can edit project metadata with concurrency safeguards
and status transitions.

**Independent Test**: Open project detail, adjust metadata, observe success
path, then trigger stale update to confirm conflict handling.

### Tests for User Story 3 (write first)

- [x] T022 [P] [US3] Add contract assertions in
      `/apps/api/tests/contract/projects-api.test.ts` for
      `PATCH /api/v1/projects/:id` requiring `If-Unmodified-Since`.
- [x] T023 [P] [US3] Extend `/apps/api/tests/integration/projects.test.ts` with
      concurrency conflict scenario and status transition checks.
- [x] T024 [P] [US3] Add Playwright spec

      `/apps/web/src/pages/Project.tsx`, including status selector tied to
      lifecycle map.
- [x] T028 [P] [US3] Provide reusable toast/dialog messaging for conflicts in
      `/apps/web/src/components/feedback/ProjectMutationAlerts.tsx`.

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 independently testable with concurrency protections
verified.

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 ‚Äì Archive a project no longer in active use (Priority: P4)

**Goal**: Authorized users can archive projects (soft delete) and restore them
while preserving audit trail.

**Independent Test**: Archive a project via dashboard, confirm removal from
active list, then restore and verify it returns with the status and metadata
captured before archival.

### Tests for User Story 4 (write first)

- [x] T029 [P] [US4] Add contract tests for `DELETE /api/v1/projects/:id` and
      `POST /api/v1/projects/:id/restore` in
      `/apps/api/tests/contract/projects-api.test.ts`.

- [x] T043 [P] [US4] Add Playwright or integration coverage ensuring viewers see
      archive notification and guided redirect when a project is archived
      mid-session.

### Implementation for User Story 4

- [x] T032 [US4] Implement archive and restore handlers in
      `/apps/api/src/routes/projects.ts`, capturing pre-archive status/metadata,
      updating activity logs, and returning the restored state.
- [x] T033 [US4] Add repository helpers (`archiveProject`, `restoreProject`)
      that persist pre-archive status metadata and adjust soft-delete filtering
      in `/packages/shared-data/src/models/project.ts`.
- [x] T034 [US4] Extend API client (`/apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`) and context to
      expose archive/restore mutations with query invalidation and restored
      status hydration.
- [x] T035 [US4] Introduce archive controls (overflow menu, confirm dialog) in
      `/apps/web/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` and accompanying badge updates
      reflecting restored status.
- [x] T044 [US4] Surface archive-notification UX for active viewers
      (toast/banner plus redirect) backed by refetch/polling to handle
      concurrent archive events.

**Checkpoint**: All four user stories complete; archived projects handled
end-to-end.

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final hardening across stories.

- [x] T036 [P] [Polish] Update `/specs/016-a-user-should-be-able/quickstart.md`
      with final verification steps and troubleshooting notes.
- [x] T037 [Polish] Audit logging and request tracing in
      `/apps/api/src/routes/projects.ts` to ensure new operations emit
      structured logs per Constitution.
- [x] T038 [P] [Polish] Run full verification suite (`pnpm lint`,
      `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test`,
      `pnpm --filter @ctrl-freaq/web test:e2e:quick`) and capture results in
      implementation log.
- [x] T045 [Polish] Instrument create and dashboard flows to capture
      SC-001/SC-002 timings (telemetry hooks, Vitest/Playwright assertions,
      quickstart updates).
- [x] T046 [Polish] Define and document success-rate sampling process for SC-003
      (QA checklist, telemetry aggregation, troubleshooting guidance).
- [x] T047 [Polish] Add archived-project audit sampling script/tests to ensure
      <5% manual correction rate per SC-004.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

- **Phase 1 ‚Üí Phase 2**: Setup tasks enable foundational schema work.
- **Phase 2 ‚Üí User Stories**: Foundational lifecycle schema/migration must land
  before any user story begins.
- **User Story Dependencies**:
  - US1 is the MVP baseline.
  - US2 builds on query infrastructure introduced in US1 but can run after
    foundation + US1 completion.
  - US3 depends on US1 API changes to exist (PATCH handler updates extend
    earlier work).
  - US4 relies on lifecycle fields and repository helpers from foundation and
    may proceed after US1 (archive actions require creation list).
- **Polish**: Final sweep after desired stories complete, including
  success-criteria instrumentation (T045‚ÄìT047).

---

## Parallel Execution Examples

- After Phase 2, contract/integration/Playwright tests for each story (e.g.,
  T008‚ÄìT010) can be authored in parallel.
- API client updates (T012, T019, T026, T034) touch the same file and should run
  sequentially, but UI tasks on different components (T013, T020, T027, T035)
  can be split across engineers once dependencies met.
- Migration work (T006) should complete before parallelizing other phases to
  avoid rebasing conflicts.
- Reserve Polish instrumentation tasks (T045‚ÄìT047) until after user stories
  settle to avoid noisy telemetry baselines.

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First

1. Complete Phases 1‚Äì2.
2. Deliver User Story 1 (T008‚ÄìT014) and validate via quickstart‚Äîthis is the
   minimum deployable increment.

### Incremental Delivery

- Post-MVP, deliver US2 for richer dashboard context, then US3 concurrency
  improvements, finishing with US4 archive capability.
- Each story has its own tests ensuring independent demo readiness.

### Team Parallelism

- Developer A: Foundation + US1 backend.
- Developer B: US1 frontend + US2 query/UI work.
- Developer C: US3/US4 API + tests once earlier phases land.
