# Feature Specification: Streaming UX for Document Editor

**Feature Branch**: `[012-epic-2-story-7]`  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Epic 2, Story 7"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09

- Q: How should the system handle multiple streaming requests triggered for the
  same section before the active interaction finishes? → A: Keep only the newest
  pending request; replace earlier queued ones.
- Q: What concurrency rule applies when a user starts streaming interactions in
  different sections? → A: Allow one active interaction per section; different
  sections can stream at the same time.
- Q: What peak number of concurrent streaming interactions per workspace should
  the system support without degrading performance targets? → A: 40+ concurrent
  interactions without a hard cap.
- Q: What uniquely identifies each `StreamingInteractionSession` record for
  persistence and telemetry? → A: A server-generated UUID `sessionId`.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Streamed Co-Author Guidance (Priority: P1)

A staff engineer editing an architecture section requests AI guidance and sees
the co-author assistant stream insights and proposed copy directly into the
sidebar without the editor freezing.

**Why this priority**: Streaming feedback keeps the core editing loop responsive
and proves that AI support is trustworthy during the highest-frequency
interaction.

**Independent Test**: Trigger co-author explain and suggest actions for multiple
sections and confirm streaming begins within target latency, progress cues stay
visible, and the final summary is preserved in the session log; repeat the same
flow for document QA review to ensure parity across interaction modes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an author requests the co-author assistant to suggest improvements,
   **When** the assistant begins processing, **Then** a streaming response
   appears in the active sidebar within 0.3 seconds, shows the current stage and
   elapsed time, and keeps updating until a completion summary chip posts to the
   session transcript.
2. **Given** an AI response is streaming, **When** the author opens the diff
   preview or continues editing within the section, **Then** streaming updates
   continue without blocking editor input and the final proposal remains
   available in the conversation history after completion.

### User Story 2 - Assumption Flow Progress (Priority: P2)

A staff engineer starting a blank section works through the assumption loop and
watches rationale, risks, and follow-up prompts stream in as they answer each
question so they always know what the system is processing next.

**Why this priority**: Transparent progress during assumption capture prevents
abandonment of blank sections and keeps policy alignment visible.

**Independent Test**: Start a new section, complete assumption prompts, defer a
question, and verify streaming updates narrate progress, pause correctly, and
resume when the loop continues.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the assumption loop is collecting rationale, **When** AI narration
   is generated, **Then** the response area streams ordered bullet updates with
   context tags, announces each new entry to assistive tech, and highlights open
   risks until the loop advances.
2. **Given** an assumption response is streaming, **When** the author chooses to
   defer the prompt, **Then** streaming pauses immediately, the mode indicator
   resets to "Deferred", and the partial content remains visible with guidance
   on resuming later.

### User Story 3 - Graceful Fallback Delivery (Priority: P3)

An engineer working from a secured environment that blocks streaming still
requests AI assistance and receives the full response with context, rationale,
and next steps once processing finishes.

**Why this priority**: Ensuring parity without streaming prevents blocked work
in restricted networks and maintains trust in AI guidance.

**Independent Test**: Disable streaming transport, request co-author support,
and confirm the UI announces fallback mode, provides elapsed time updates, and
delivers the full response with the same metadata the streaming path supplies.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** streaming transport is unavailable or interrupted, **When** a user
   requests AI support, **Then** the UI declares that it is operating in
   fallback mode, displays a deterministic progress indicator with elapsed time,
   and delivers the full response once ready without discarding the active
   context.
2. **Given** a fallback response is delivered, **When** the author reviews the
   output, **Then** the conversation transcript records the response with the
   same rationale, confidence, and citation details promised for streamed
   content so reviewers see identical evidence.

### Edge Cases

- Streaming transport drops mid-interaction: retry once within the same session,
  then switch to fallback while preserving received tokens and logging the
  change in state.
- Multiple streaming requests are triggered for the same section: replace any
  existing queued request with the newest one, display a visible notice, and
  prevent overlapping responses that could overwrite context.
- Simultaneous streaming in different sections: allow each section to continue
  its own interaction independently while maintaining distinct status cues,
  history entries, and telemetry records.
- Document QA streaming must follow the same queue replacement, concurrency, and
  telemetry rules as co-authoring and assumption flows so parity is preserved.
- Server emits out-of-order streaming events: buffer and present updates in
  chronological order across co-authoring, document QA, and assumption flows
  while noting discrepancies in telemetry for debugging.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST stream incremental updates for co-authoring, document
  QA, and assumption-resolution interactions within the document editor so
  authors see progress without leaving the active workspace.
- **FR-002**: System MUST surface a visible streaming indicator that includes
  phase labels and elapsed time within 0.3 seconds of the request start and keep
  it in view until completion, cancellation, or fallback.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow authors to continue editing, navigating, or
  opening diff previews while streaming occurs and must persist the final
  response in the session history once streaming completes.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide accessible announcements for streaming start,
  update, completion, cancellation, and fallback states so screen reader users
  receive equivalent cues.
- **FR-005**: System MUST offer cancel and retry controls for active streaming
  interactions and confirm the resulting status (canceled, retried, fallback) in
  the UI without losing previously delivered content.
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect transport failures or unsupported environments
  within 3 seconds and automatically transition the interaction into the
  fallback delivery path while notifying the author.
- **FR-007**: System MUST deliver identical final content, rationale, confidence
  indicators, and citations whether the interaction streamed or used the
  fallback path.
- **FR-008**: System MUST record telemetry for each streaming interaction,
  including start time, time to first update, completion status, fallback usage,
  and cancellation reasons, to support observability goals.
- **FR-009**: System MUST enforce a single active streaming interaction per
  section, replace any existing queued request with the newest request while
  displaying a status message, prevent overlapping responses from overwriting
  session context, allow concurrent streaming interactions across different
  sections, and resequence out-of-order events for co-authoring, document QA,
  and assumption flows before rendering.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **StreamingInteractionSession**: Represents one AI-supported workflow request,
  keyed by a server-generated UUID `sessionId`, storing the triggering context
  (document, section, mode), timestamps, current state, fallback status, and a
  pointer to the final response summary.
- **StreamingProgressEvent**: Captures ordered progress updates with stage
  labels, timestamps, partial content snippets, and delivery channel (streaming
  or fallback) for presentation and telemetry.
- **StreamingFallbackRecord**: Logs the conditions that required fallback,
  associated interaction session, time of switch, final delivery outcome, and
  audit notes shared with reviewers.

## Success Criteria _(mandatory)_

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of AI-assisted interactions display the first visible update
  within 0.3 seconds of request start, measured across instrumented sessions.
- **SC-002**: 100% of streaming interactions maintain a visible or audible
  progress cue from initiation until completion, cancellation, or fallback,
  confirmed through accessibility acceptance tests.
- **SC-003**: 0% of interactions lose content or deliver duplicate outputs when
  fallback mode activates during testing scenarios covering transport failure,
  unsupported browsers, and manual cancellation.
- **SC-004**: At least 85% of pilot users report increased confidence that AI
  assistance is working as expected because of streaming cues in post-session
  surveys (Likert score ≥4 on a 5-point scale).
- **SC-005**: Workspaces sustain 40 or more simultaneous streaming interactions
  without the median time to first update exceeding 0.3 seconds.

## Assumptions

- Streaming interactions rely on the established SSE transport used by the
  existing co-authoring service; no new protocol changes are required.
- Fallback delivery reuses the same proposal and rationale generators to ensure
  content parity.
- Existing telemetry infrastructure can capture additional streaming metrics
  without delaying the feature release.
- Peak workspace load assumes 40+ concurrent streaming interactions with no
  enforced cap while still meeting latency targets.
