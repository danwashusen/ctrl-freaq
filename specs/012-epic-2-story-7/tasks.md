# Tasks: Streaming UX for Document Editor

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/012-epic-2-story-7/` **Prerequisites**:
plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md,
data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are mandated by the constitution; each story lists test-first
tasks.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story so each increment is
independently deliverable.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact repository-root anchored file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Align contributors on scope and ensure workspace readiness.

- [x] T001 [Setup] Review `/specs/012-epic-2-story-7/spec.md` and
      `/specs/012-epic-2-story-7/plan.md` to confirm streaming requirements,
      success criteria, edge cases, and architectural constraints.
- [x] T002 [P] [Setup] Verify workspace dependencies via `pnpm install` using
      `/package.json` and `/pnpm-lock.yaml`, documenting any install deltas.
- [x] T003 [Setup] Cross-check research and contracts in
      `/specs/012-epic-2-story-7/research.md` and
      `/specs/012-epic-2-story-7/contracts/streaming-openapi.yaml` so engineers
      share queue replacement, cancel/retry, and fallback expectations.

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST exist before any user story work
begins.

- [x] T004 [Foundational] Add shared DTOs for `StreamingInteractionSession`,
      `StreamingProgressEvent`, and `StreamingFallbackRecord` in
      `/packages/shared-data/src/co-authoring/streaming-interaction-session.ts`,
      exporting them via `/packages/shared-data/src/co-authoring/index.ts` and
      `/packages/shared-data/src/index.ts` for co-authoring, document QA, and
      assumptions.
- [x] T005 [Foundational] Extend persistence typings and migration scaffolding
      in `/packages/shared-data/src/models/streaming.ts` (and doc updates in
      `/packages/shared-data/src/migrations/README.md`) to persist queue state,
      cancel/retry metadata, and fallback diagnostics.
- [x] T006 [Foundational] Author failing unit tests in
      `/packages/editor-core/src/streaming/section-stream-queue.test.ts`
      covering newest-request replacement, single active per section,
      concurrency slot calculation, and cancel propagation.
- [x] T007 [Foundational] Implement `section-stream-queue` utilities in
      `/packages/editor-core/src/streaming/section-stream-queue.ts` (enqueue,
      replace pending, cancel, concurrency slot tracking) and export from
      `/packages/editor-core/src/index.ts`.

**Checkpoint**: Shared data types and queue utilities readyâ€”user story work may
begin.

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Streamed Co-Author & QA Guidance (Priority: P1) ðŸŽ¯ MVP

**Goal**: Ensure co-authoring and document QA interactions stream within 0.3s,
respect per-section serialization, expose cancel/retry controls, and keep the
editor responsive.

**Independent Test**: Trigger co-author guidance and document QA review on
separate sections; confirm first update <0.3s, cancel/retry controls report
status, editing remains unblocked, and session logs persist final summaries.

### Tests for User Story 1 (write first, ensure they fail)

- [x] T008 [US1] Expand
      `/apps/api/src/services/co-authoring/ai-proposal.service.test.ts` with
      failing cases for newest-request replacement, cancel/retry flows,
      out-of-order event buffering, concurrency slots, and telemetry assertions.
- [x] T009 [P] [US1] Extend
      `/apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/useCoAuthorSession.test.tsx`
      with failing specs covering visible progress cues, cancel/retry
      confirmation, out-of-order event resequencing, and editing responsiveness.
- [x] T010 [US1] Create failing API coverage in
      `/apps/api/tests/unit/document-qa/document-qa-streaming.service.test.ts`
      verifying document QA streams reuse queue rules, buffer out-of-order
      events, honor cancel/retry, and emit telemetry.
- [x] T011 [P] [US1] Add failing UI test in
      `/apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/useDocumentQaSession.test.tsx`
      confirming document QA streaming parity, replacement notices, out-of-order
      resequencing, and cancel/retry status messaging.

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [x] T012 [US1] Update
      `/apps/api/src/services/co-authoring/ai-proposal.service.ts` to enforce
      single active streams, replace pending sessions, buffer and reorder
      out-of-sequence events, and implement cancel/retry handlers that propagate
      statuses and concurrency metrics.
- [x] T013 [US1] Enhance `/apps/api/src/routes/co-authoring.ts` to expose
      cancel/retry endpoints, return updated session metadata (sessionId,
      concurrencySlot, replacement policy), and surface cancel/retry outcomes.
- [x] T014 [P] [US1] Extend `/apps/api/src/middleware/ai-request-audit.ts` to
      log queue disposition (`active`, `replaced`, `canceled`, `fallback`) with
      request IDs, cancel reasons, and out-of-order discrepancy flags.
- [x] T015 [P] [US1] Update
      `/apps/web/src/features/document-editor/stores/co-authoring-store.ts` to
      manage pending replacement state, cancel/retry status, and final
      transcript retention.
- [x] T016 [P] [US1] Refine
      `/apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/useCoAuthorSession.ts` to
      consume new SSE payloads, orchestrate cancel/retry commands, and keep
      editor actions non-blocking.
- [x] T017 [P] [US1] Refresh
      `/apps/web/src/features/document-editor/components/co-authoring/SessionProgress.tsx`
      and
      `/apps/web/src/features/document-editor/components/co-authoring/CoAuthorSidebar.tsx`
      to display stage labels, elapsed timers, replacement notices, cancel/retry
      confirmations, and out-of-order buffering indicators with ARIA live
      regions.
- [x] T018 [P] [US1] Extend `/apps/web/src/lib/streaming/progress-tracker.ts`
      and `/apps/web/src/lib/streaming/progress-tracker.test.ts` to guarantee
      visible indicators within 0.3s while tracking cancel/retry events.
- [x] T019 [US1] Implement document QA streaming service in
      `/apps/api/src/modules/document-qa/services/document-qa-streaming.service.ts`
      (new module) reusing queue utilities, cancel/retry logic, out-of-order
      buffering, and telemetry hooks.
- [x] T020 [US1] Expose document QA SSE routes in
      `/apps/api/src/routes/document-qa.ts` (new file) and register them in
      `/apps/api/src/routes/index.ts`, ensuring consistent response metadata.
- [x] T021 [P] [US1] Create
      `/apps/web/src/features/document-editor/stores/document-qa-store.ts` to
      track document QA session state, queue status, and cancel/retry outcomes.
- [x] T022 [P] [US1] Build
      `/apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/useDocumentQaSession.ts`
      mirroring co-author behaviour for document QA streaming, cancel/retry, and
      history persistence.
- [x] T023 [P] [US1] Implement
      `/apps/web/src/features/document-editor/components/document-qa/DocumentQaPanel.tsx`
      to present streaming updates, replacement notices, out-of-order buffering
      notices, and cancel/retry controls with accessible announcements.
- [x] T024 [P] [US1] Extend telemetry utilities in
      `/apps/web/src/lib/telemetry/client-events.ts` and
      `/apps/web/src/lib/telemetry/client-events.test.ts` to emit document QA
      streaming metrics, out-of-order correction events, cancel reasons, and
      fallback diagnostics.

**Checkpoint**: Co-authoring and document QA streaming deliver responsive
updates with full cancel/retry support, telemetry, and accessible UIâ€”MVP
complete.

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Assumption Flow Progress (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Stream assumption rationale, risks, and prompts with pause/resume
handling so authors always understand loop progress.

**Independent Test**: Start the assumption loop, observe ordered streaming
bullets with context tags, defer a prompt, and verify streaming pauses and
resumes with guidance intact.

### Tests for User Story 2 (write first, ensure they fail)

- [x] T025 [US2] Add failing service tests in
      `/apps/api/src/modules/section-editor/services/assumption-session.service.test.ts`
      covering ordered streaming events, defer pause/resume, out-of-order
      buffering, and telemetry.
- [x] T026 [P] [US2] Create failing UI test in
      `/apps/web/src/features/document-editor/assumptions-flow/hooks/use-assumptions-flow.test.tsx`
      validating announcements, bullet updates, defer/resume status, cancel
      behavior, and resequencing indicators.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [x] T027 [US2] Enhance
      `/apps/api/src/modules/section-editor/services/assumption-session.service.ts`
      to emit streaming progress events with context tags, buffer/resequence
      out-of-order payloads, support defer/resume, and integrate cancel
      propagation.
- [x] T028 [P] [US2] Wire `/apps/api/src/routes/sections.ts` SSE handlers to
      expose assumption streaming, replacement notifications, cancel responses,
      and resequencing metadata.
- [x] T029 [P] [US2] Update
      `/apps/web/src/features/document-editor/assumptions-flow/hooks/use-assumptions-flow.ts`
      to process streaming payloads, resequence out-of-order events, manage
      defer/resume transitions, and dispatch ARIA notifications.
- [x] T030 [P] [US2] Refresh
      `/apps/web/src/features/document-editor/assumptions-flow/components/assumptions-checklist.tsx`
      to render progress bullets, highlight open risks, show status chips, and
      surface resequencing notices when applicable.
- [x] T031 [P] [US2] Extend telemetry client events in
      `/apps/web/src/lib/telemetry/client-events.ts` and
      `/apps/web/src/lib/telemetry/client-events.test.ts` to capture assumption
      streaming metrics, defer outcomes, cancel reasons, and out-of-order
      correction signals.

**Checkpoint**: Assumption loop shows continuous progress, handles deferrals and
cancels correctly, and records telemetry.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Graceful Fallback Delivery (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Provide parity when streaming is blockedâ€”announce fallback, maintain
elapsed time, and deliver identical content with metadata.

**Independent Test**: Disable streaming, request co-author and document QA
support, confirm fallback announcement, deterministic progress, and parity of
final responses plus transcript metadata.

### Tests for User Story 3 (write first, ensure they fail)

- [x] T032 [US3] Expand
      `/apps/api/src/services/co-authoring/ai-proposal.service.test.ts` with
      fallback scenarios asserting preserved tokens, rationale parity, cancel
      interactions, and telemetry.
- [x] T033 [P] [US3] Add failing UI test in
      `/apps/web/src/lib/streaming/fallback-messages.test.ts` verifying
      deterministic progress copy, elapsed timers, cancel/fallback messaging,
      and accessibility cues.

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [x] T034 [US3] Implement fallback orchestration in
      `/apps/api/src/services/co-authoring/ai-proposal.service.ts`, ensuring
      preserved tokens, retry attempts, and final delivery metadata populate
      telemetry (including cancel interactions leading to fallback).
- [x] T035 [P] [US3] Update `/apps/api/src/routes/co-authoring.ts` and
      `/apps/api/src/routes/document-qa.ts` to expose fallback status over
      REST/SSE with identical rationale, confidence, and citation payloads.
- [x] T036 [P] [US3] Enhance
      `/apps/web/src/features/document-editor/components/co-authoring/SessionProgress.tsx`
      and
      `/apps/web/src/features/document-editor/components/document-qa/DocumentQaPanel.tsx`
      to surface fallback banners, deterministic progress indicators, and
      transcript parity messages.
- [x] T037 [P] [US3] Extend `/apps/web/src/lib/streaming/fallback-messages.ts`
      (and tests) to generate accessible copy mirroring streaming metadata for
      co-authoring, document QA, and assumptions.
- [x] T038 [P] [US3] Ensure fallback handling propagates through assumptions by
      updating
      `/apps/web/src/features/document-editor/assumptions-flow/hooks/use-assumptions-flow.ts`
      and
      `/apps/web/src/features/document-editor/assumptions-flow/components/assumptions-checklist.tsx`.
- [x] T039 [P] [US3] Log fallback telemetry in
      `/apps/web/src/lib/telemetry/client-events.ts` and
      `/apps/api/src/middleware/ai-request-audit.ts`, capturing root causes,
      preserved tokens, cancel reasons, and retry attempts across all
      interaction modes.

**Checkpoint**: Fallback path mirrors streaming experience with complete
telemetry, accessible guidance, and cancel/fallback parity.

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Finalize documentation, validation, and cross-story consistency.

- [x] T040 [Polish] Update `/specs/012-epic-2-story-7/quickstart.md` with
      verified local validation steps covering co-authoring, document QA,
      assumptions, and fallback toggles.
- [x] T041 [Polish] Run full quality gates (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`,
      `pnpm test`, `pnpm --filter @ctrl-freaq/web test:e2e:quick`) from
      repository root `/` and capture results for the implementation report.

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)** â†’ prerequisite for all remaining work.
- **Foundational (Phase 2)** â†’ depends on Setup; blocks every user story until
  shared types and queue utilities (with cancel support) exist.
- **User Stories (Phases 3â€“5)** â†’ each depends on Foundational completion;
  execute in priority order (P1 â†’ P2 â†’ P3) or in parallel once blockers clear.
- **Polish (Phase 6)** â†’ runs after desired user stories are complete.

### User Story Dependencies

- **US1 (P1)** â†’ first deliverable; no dependency on other stories.
- **US2 (P2)** â†’ depends on queue utilities from Foundational but not on US1
  output; can start once Phase 2 is done.
- **US3 (P3)** â†’ builds on API structures touched in US1; recommended to start
  after US1 to reuse updated co-author and document QA services.

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (T008â€“T011, T025â€“T026, T032â€“T033) must be written and failing before
  implementation tasks.
- API updates precede UI wiring for the same feature to keep contract stability.
- Telemetry updates occur after core functionality adjustments within each
  story.

---

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

- After Phase 2, US1 API work (T012, T019) and front-end work (T015â€“T023) can
  proceed in parallel once SSE payload formats are finalized.
- In US2, tasks T027 (API) and T029/T030 (web) can run concurrently with T028
  and T031 covering routing and telemetry.
- In US3, UI enhancements T036â€“T038 can progress independently from API updates
  T034â€“T035, provided fallback payload shapes are stubs.

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phases 1â€“2.
2. Deliver US1 (T008â€“T024), validate co-authoring/document QA streaming latency,
   cancel/retry, and telemetry.
3. Demo MVP to stakeholders before proceeding.

### Incremental Delivery

1. After MVP, implement US2 (T025â€“T031) to enrich assumption workflows.
2. Finish with US3 (T032â€“T039) for fallback parity across all modes.
3. Polish tasks (T040â€“T041) close out the feature.

### Parallel Team Strategy

- Developer A: Focus on API tasks (T012, T019, T027, T034) sequentially.
- Developer B: Handle web stores/hooks (T015, T021, T029, T038).
- Developer C: Own UI components and telemetry (T017, T023, T030, T036, T039).
- All developers share responsibility for test-first tasks and checkpoints.

---

## Assumption Log

- Assumption: Queue manager utilities in
  `/packages/editor-core/src/streaming/section-stream-queue.ts` serve
  co-authoring, document QA, and assumptions to satisfy FR-009 and cancel/retry
  consistency.  
  Rationale: Centralizing concurrency logic avoids divergent implementations and
  ensures telemetry parity.
- Assumption: Document QA streaming shares the co-authoring contract
  shapeâ€”service methods (`startReview`, `cancelReview`, `retryReview`) return
  queue metadata, and the UI hook exposes progress stage labels, replacement
  notices, cancel/retry status, and editing-lock flags.  
  Rationale: Tasks T010â€“T011 call for parity across interaction modes; mirroring
  co-authoring APIs keeps tests and UI expectations aligned while the dedicated
  QA modules are implemented.
- [ASSUMPTION] Document QA reviews can derive a default prompt from the current
  document and section identifiers when the UI does not supply custom copy.  
  Rationale: The specification does not define a reviewer prompt input; using a
  deterministic default keeps the API contract satisfied until a dedicated QA
  prompt surface ships.

---

## Phase 4.R: Review Follow-Up

- [x] F004 Finding F004: Cross-mode streaming queue gap allows overlapping
      sessions per sectionâ€”share a single `SectionStreamQueue` (or coordinator)
      across co-authoring, document QA, and assumption flows, update assumption
      streaming to participate in the queue, and attach cross-mode serialization
      tests as outlined in `audit.md`.
- [x] F005 Finding F005: TypeScript status narrowing breaks builds and
      testsâ€”`AssumptionStreamController.emitStatus` now defends against unknown
      statuses via `isAssumptionStatus`, keeping `pnpm typecheck`/`pnpm test`
      green (see audit.md, 2025-10-12).
- [x] F006 Finding F006: Document QA streaming omits transcript contentâ€”emit
      actual token updates (and fallback parity) from
      `DocumentQaStreamingService` so the QA panel surfaces guidance, verified
      in audit.md (2025-10-13).
