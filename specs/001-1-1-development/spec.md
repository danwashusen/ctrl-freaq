## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer joining the CTRL FreaQ project, I need to quickly set up a fully functional local development environment that includes the frontend application, backend API server, all required library packages, and comprehensive test infrastructure, so that I can immediately start contributing to the project with confidence that my environment matches team standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh clone of the repository, **When** I run the setup command, **Then** all dependencies are installed and the development environment is ready
2. **Given** the development environment is set up, **When** I run the dev command, **Then** both frontend (port 5173) and backend (port 5001) services start successfully
3. **Given** the services are running, **When** I navigate to the frontend URL, **Then** I see the Dashboard with working authentication
4. **Given** the backend is running, **When** I access the health endpoint, **Then** I receive a successful response
5. **Given** the monorepo is configured, **When** I run the test command, **Then** all placeholder tests execute successfully
6. **Given** the codebase is set up, **When** I run type checking, **Then** all code passes strict TypeScript validation
7. **Given** a library package exists, **When** I examine its structure, **Then** it includes CLI interface, exports, documentation, and independence requirements

### Edge Cases
- What happens when ports 5173 or 5001 are already in use?
- How does the system handle missing environment variables or configuration files?
- What occurs if package installation fails due to network issues?
- How does the setup handle different Node.js versions or operating systems?
- What happens when authentication keys are not configured?
