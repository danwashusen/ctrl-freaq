# Feature Specification: Conversational Co-Authoring Integration

**Feature Branch**: `[011-epic-2-story-6]`  
**Created**: 2025-10-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Epic 2, Story 6"

## Execution Flow (main)

1. An authenticated author opens a document section and summons the co-authoring
   assistant from the editor sidebar without leaving their current view.
2. The system assembles section context — current draft, last approved version,
   relevant document decisions, and any knowledge items the author selects — and
   displays the active scope so the user understands what the assistant can
   reference.
3. The author requests support (explain, outline, suggest improvements) and
   receives conversational guidance that keeps the draft unchanged until the
   author explicitly asks for a proposal.
4. When the author requests a proposal, the assistant returns a diff preview
   that highlights insertions/deletions, maps each change to the prompt that
   produced it, and surfaces confidence and citation cues for review.
5. The author accepts, edits, or rejects the proposal; approval queues the
   change behind existing draft persistence, records a section-level changelog
   entry, and updates the conversation log with the applied outcome.
6. Conversation history from the active session stays visible while the section
   view remains open; once the session ends, rely on section-level changelog
   entries and approved diffs for auditability.

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- Keep human agency explicit: AI never alters section content without a
  deliberate approval path that mirrors
  `/docs/front-end-spec.md#ai-interface-component-library` controls.
- Make scope obvious: every chat exchange reiterates which section and knowledge
  sources are in play so authors avoid cross-document confusion.
- Tie guidance to rationale: conversational replies should reference the
  decisions and assumptions captured in
  `/docs/prd.md#epic-2-details--document-editor-core` so reviewers can trace why
  a draft changed.

### Section Requirements

- Cover explain/outline/suggest flows, diff previews, approval mechanics, and
  changelog updates together; shipping a partial subset leaves the story
  incomplete.
- Respect the constitution’s human-in-the-loop mandate: approval, audit logging,
  and transparency are non-negotiable.

### For AI Generation

1. Honor section state: proposals must reflect the current local draft, not just
   the last server version.
2. Provide actionable justifications (citations, bullet rationales) with every
   suggestion so authors can assess fit quickly.
3. Downgrade gracefully when AI cannot respond — keep the conversation intact
   and direct the author toward manual editing rather than failing silently.
4. Always include the entire document (all completed sections) when constructing
   AI provider prompts so proposals reflect the full context.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- Q: How should section conversation history (prompts, AI replies, proposals) be
  persisted and shared for auditing? → A: Option D — Do not persist beyond the
  active session; rely on changelog entries only.
- Q: What content may be shared with the AI provider when generating
  conversational responses for a section? → A: Entire document (all completed
  sections).
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable time from request to diff preview for AI
  proposals in this workflow? → A: Option D — No strict limit as long as
  progress is shown.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A staff engineer revising an architecture section consults the conversational
co-author to analyze the current copy, request an improved draft, inspect the
proposed diff with supporting rationale, and apply the change with a recorded
justification when it meets project standards.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an author is viewing a section, **When** they open the co-author
   assistant and ask for clarification or an outline, **Then** the system
   responds with section-scoped guidance that references relevant decisions
   without modifying the draft.
2. **Given** the author requests a content improvement, **When** the assistant
   generates a proposal, **Then** the editor shows a diff preview linked to the
   originating prompt, cites the supporting context, and offers
   approve/edit/reject controls without applying changes yet.
3. **Given** the author approves the proposal, **When** they confirm the action,
   **Then** the system applies the diff to the local draft, logs the approval
   with author identity and timestamp, and appends a section-level changelog
   entry visible to reviewers.

### Edge Cases

- If a proposal conflicts with edits made after the request, highlight the
  conflict, require the author to regenerate or re-run diffing, and avoid
  overwriting unsaved work.
- When the AI cannot produce a confident response, surface a fallback message
  explaining the limitation, preserve the conversation, and provide options to
  retry with adjusted prompts or switch to manual edits.
- If the author navigates away mid-conversation, ensure the assistant reopens
  with the previous thread, context, and pending suggestions when they return to
  the section.
- Limit proposals to the active section; if a request would alter other
  sections, warn the author and direct them to the appropriate context instead
  of applying cross-section changes.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a section-scoped conversational assistant
  accessible from both read and edit states without disrupting the author’s
  current view.
- **FR-002**: System MUST support at least three intent modes—explain, outline,
  and suggest improvements—and display the active intent so the author
  understands the assistant’s role.
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow authors to curate contextual inputs (approved
  sections, knowledge items, decision logs) while automatically including the
  entire document of completed sections in each provider call.
- **FR-004**: System MUST present proposed changes as diff previews that
  highlight additions and removals, link each block to the originating prompt,
  and show rationale or citations before any content is applied.
- **FR-005**: System MUST require explicit author approval before applying a
  proposal, offering edit-before-apply and reject paths that leave the existing
  draft untouched.
- **FR-006**: System MUST, upon approval, apply the accepted diff to the local
  draft persistence layer, capture the approving author and timestamp, and
  append a section-level changelog entry summarizing why the change was adopted.
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain conversation context only for the active
  editing session, purge transcripts immediately when the author switches
  sections, navigates away, or logs out, and log approved proposals in the
  section-level changelog so reviewers can audit AI-assisted changes without
  persisting transcript data.
- **FR-008**: System MUST enforce section boundaries by preventing proposals
  from modifying content outside the active section and alerting the author when
  a request exceeds that scope.
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear fallback messaging with retry and
  manual-edit guidance when the assistant cannot fulfill a request, ensuring no
  interaction ends without direction.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Target streaming of the first proposal tokens within ~3 seconds
  (95th percentile) without enforcing a hard SLA, and ALWAYS surface continuous
  progress indicators, elapsed time, and cancel/retry controls once processing
  exceeds 5 seconds.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **SectionConversationSession** _(formerly Section Conversation Thread)_:
  Maintains the ordered list of prompts and AI responses for the active session
  only, including selected context sources, intent mode, and status of any
  resulting proposals before the section view closes, and MUST purge its
  transcript when the author navigates away, logs out, or the session expires.
- **AI Proposal Snapshot**: Represents a generated diff with mapped rationale,
  confidence indicators, and approval state (pending, applied, rejected) tied to
  the originating conversation entry.
- **Section Changelog Entry**: Captures applied AI-assisted changes with author
  identity, timestamp, rationale summary, and pointers back to the conversation
  thread for review traceability.
