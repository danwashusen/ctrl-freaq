# Code Review Report: Conversational Co-Authoring Integration (011-epic-2-story-6)

## Final Status: **Approved**

## Resolved Scope

**Branch**: `011-epic-2-story-6` **Baseline**: `main` **Diff Source**: Working
tree (`HEAD` vs `main`) **Review Target**: Story 6 co-authoring experience
across API streaming, shared libraries, AI toolkit, and document-editor UI
**Files Analyzed**: 46 changed files covering API middleware/services/tests,
shared-data value objects, editor-core diff utilities, AI CLI/session code, web
store/hook/components/tests, fixtures, and Story 6 dossier docs

**Resolved Scope Narrative**: Verified the end-to-end conversational
co-authoring pipeline: shared models feed the API diff mapper, SSE events stream
stable segment IDs and diff hashes, client hooks normalize patches while
progress timers surface accessible cancel controls, and the AI CLI mirrors
runtime behaviour for replay/debug parity.

**Feature Directory**:
`/Users/danwas/Development/Projects/ctrl-freaq/specs/011-epic-2-story-6`
**Implementation Scope**:

- Shared co-authoring value objects, diff utilities, and exports
  (`packages/shared-data/src/co-authoring/*`,
  `packages/editor-core/src/diff/section-proposal.ts`,
  `packages/shared-data/src/index.ts`)
- Co-authoring services, rate limiting, middleware, and contract coverage

- Session rate limiter & telemetry wiring
  (`apps/api/src/routes/co-authoring-rate-limiter.ts`,
  `apps/api/src/services/co-authoring/ai-proposal.service.ts`)
- AI proposal runner, replay provider, and CLI command
  (`packages/ai/src/session/proposal-runner.ts`, `packages/ai/src/cli.ts`,
  `packages/ai/src/cli.test.ts`)
- Frontend co-authoring store, hook, components, streaming utilities, and E2E
  coverage (`apps/web/src/features/document-editor/**`,
  `apps/web/src/lib/streaming/**`,
  `apps/web/tests/e2e/document-editor/co-authoring.e2e.ts`)

## Findings

### Active Findings (Current Iteration)

None.

### Historical Findings Log

- [Resolved 2025-10-09] F013: SSE diff payload omits segment identifiers,
  blanking the proposal preview — Reported 2025-10-09 by Claude Code Review
  v2.0. Resolution: Diff mapper now propagates `segmentId` metadata and
  canonical hashes, and the UI normalizes streamed segments with regression
  coverage. Evidence: `apps/api/src/services/co-authoring/diff-mapper.ts:65`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/useCoAuthorSession.ts:184`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/useCoAuthorSession.test.tsx:1`,
  `pnpm test` (2025-10-09). Status: Documented in `tasks.md` Phase 4.R F013
  (completed).
- [Resolved 2025-10-09] F012: Streaming progress never surfaces cancel controls
  — Reported 2025-10-09 by Claude Code Review v2.0. Resolution: Back-end
  proposal runner emits synthetic progress ticks, the hook advances elapsed time
  locally, and `SessionProgress` unlocks cancel controls with tests verifying
  the SLA threshold. Evidence: `packages/ai/src/session/proposal-runner.ts:200`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/useCoAuthorSession.ts:268`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/components/co-authoring/SessionProgress.tsx:1`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/useCoAuthorSession.test.tsx:150`,
  `pnpm test` (2025-10-09). Status: Documented in `tasks.md` Phase 4.R F012
  (completed).

## Strengths

- Diff mappings now stream deterministic `segmentId` metadata and SHA-256
  hashes, keeping server/audit/UI alignment
  (`apps/api/src/services/co-authoring/diff-mapper.ts:65`,
  `packages/editor-core/src/diff/section-proposal.ts:68`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/useCoAuthorSession.test.tsx:15`).
- Synthetic progress tracking bridges provider latency and accessible UX with
  live announcements plus cancel gating
  (`packages/ai/src/session/proposal-runner.ts:200`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/useCoAuthorSession.ts:270`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/components/co-authoring/SessionProgress.tsx:1`).
- CLI `coauthor` command replays captured payloads for deterministic debugging
  while sharing the production runner implementation
  (`packages/ai/src/cli.ts:72`, `packages/ai/src/cli.test.ts:1`).

## Outstanding Clarifications

- None.

## Decision Log

- Confirmed `mapProposalDiff` streams `segmentId` metadata and diff hashes,
  resolving F013 and satisfying FR-004.
- Verified synthetic progress timers & UI polling unlock cancel controls after
  SLA threshold, resolving F012.
- Exercised CLI `coauthor --replay` path to ensure parity with production
  `runProposalSession`.
- Executed `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, and `pnpm test` (2025-10-09) to
  capture full gauntlet signal.

## Remediation Logging

No remediation tasks required; no active findings remain.

# Code Review Report: Conversational Co-Authoring Integration (011-epic-2-story-6)

## Final Status: **Changes Requested**

## Resolved Scope

**Branch**: `011-epic-2-story-6`  
**Baseline**: `main`  
**Diff Source**: Working tree (`HEAD` vs `main`)  
**Review Target**: Story 6 co-authoring experience across API streaming, shared
libraries, AI toolkit, and document-editor UI  
**Files Analyzed**: 46 touched files spanning API middleware/services/tests,
shared-data value objects, QA audit logging, AI CLI/session code, web
stores/hooks/components/tests, fixtures, and Story 6 dossier docs

**Resolved Scope Narrative**: Revalidated the server-side streaming pipeline
(audit middleware, rate limiter, SSE proposal service) and traced the
shared-data models into the AI CLI/session runner and the document editor
hook/store. Focus this pass on the streaming diff payload that feeds the
proposal preview and on long-running session UX. Confirmed POR alignment;
uncovered a regression where the SSE diff payload no longer exposes segment
identifiers, preventing the UI from rendering annotated previews, while the
earlier cancel-control gap persists.

**Feature Directory**:

#### Finding F013: SSE diff payload omits segment identifiers, blanking the proposal preview

- **Category**: Functional
- **Severity**: Major
- **Confidence**: High
- **Impact**: `mapProposalDiff` strips the generated diff segments down to bare
  `{ type, content }` objects
  (`apps/api/src/services/co-authoring/diff-mapper.ts:65-80`), but the UI
  requires `segmentId` to map annotations and render diff rows
  (`apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/useCoAuthorSession.ts:188-215`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/components/co-authoring/ProposalPreview.tsx:94-132`).
  Because `generateProposalDiff` only attaches segment IDs to the annotations
  (`packages/editor-core/src/diff/section-proposal.ts:69-98`), the normalized
  diff array is empty client-side, so proposal previews show nothing and
  approval diffs lose traceability, violating **FR-004**.
- **Evidence**: `apps/api/src/services/co-authoring/diff-mapper.ts:65`,
  `packages/editor-core/src/diff/section-proposal.ts:69`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/useCoAuthorSession.ts:188`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/components/co-authoring/ProposalPreview.tsx:94`
- **Remediation**: Include the generated `segmentId` alongside each diff segment
  the API streams (e.g., enrich `toStreamDiff` or pair annotations back onto
  segments) so the client can render annotated diffs and so approvals compute
  hashes consistently. Add regression assertions in `diff-mapper.test.ts` and
  the hook/component tests to catch future regressions.
- **Source Requirement**: FR-004
- **Files**: `apps/api/src/services/co-authoring/diff-mapper.ts`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/useCoAuthorSession.ts`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/components/co-authoring/ProposalPreview.tsx`,
  `packages/editor-core/src/diff/section-proposal.ts`

#### Finding F012: Streaming progress never unlocks cancel controls or announcements

- **Category**: UX / Accessibility
- **Severity**: Major
- **Confidence**: High
- **Impact**: Progress events never advance past `elapsedMs: 0`; the UI timer in
  `useCoAuthorSession` relies on incoming values, so the cancel button and ARIA
  live messages never trigger when a proposal stalls, violating **NFR-001** and
  the accessibility guidance. SSE payloads only emit
  `queued`/`awaiting-approval` without intermediate ticks
  (`apps/api/src/services/co-authoring/ai-proposal.service.ts:363-592`), and the
  hook does not synthesize elapsed time while streaming
  (`apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/useCoAuthorSession.ts:342-386`).
  As a result, authors cannot cancel long-running sessions, and assistive tech
  receives no updates.
- **Evidence**: `apps/api/src/services/co-authoring/ai-proposal.service.ts:363`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/useCoAuthorSession.ts:342`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/components/co-authoring/SessionProgress.tsx:1`
- **Remediation**: Emit periodic progress events while the proposal stream is
  active (server-side timer or provider callbacks) and have the client hook
  increment elapsed time locally to unlock cancel controls at 5s. Add unit tests
  for synthetic progress and Playwright coverage ensuring the cancel button
  appears after SLA threshold.
- **Source Requirement**: NFR-001
- **Files**: `apps/api/src/services/co-authoring/ai-proposal.service.ts`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/useCoAuthorSession.ts`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/components/co-authoring/SessionProgress.tsx`

## Decision Log

- 2025-10-09: Walked the SSE payload from `mapProposalDiff` through
  `useCoAuthorSession`/`ProposalPreview`, confirming missing `segmentId`
  propagation and documenting F013.
- 2025-10-09: Re-confirmed streaming progress behaviour via
  `proposal-runner.ts`, noting no elapsed updates beyond zero (F012 remains
  open).
- 2025-10-09: Deferred rerunning lint/typecheck/test to the author; new
  regression coverage required before next review loop.

## Remediation Logging

### Remediation R5 (F013)

- **Context**: Proposal diff streams omit `segmentId`, so the UI drops all
  segments and annotations.
- **Control Reference**: Diff streaming contract
  (`apps/api/src/services/co-authoring/diff-mapper.ts:65`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/useCoAuthorSession.ts:188`).
- **Actions**: Emit `segmentId` with each diff segment (or rejoin annotations
  onto segments) before streaming; update frontend normalization/tests to assert
  IDs exist and render; add contract/component/E2E coverage to lock the
  behaviour.
- **Verification**: `pnpm --filter @ctrl-freaq/api test`,
  `pnpm --filter @ctrl-freaq/web test`, Playwright co-authoring scenario showing
  annotated diff rows.

### Remediation R4 (F012)

- **Context**: Streaming progress never reports elapsed time ≥5 s, so cancel
  controls and live-region announcements never trigger.
- **Control Reference**: Streaming telemetry + progress tracker
  (`packages/ai/src/session/proposal-runner.ts:215`,
  `apps/web/src/lib/streaming/progress-tracker.ts:15`).
- **Actions**: Emit periodic elapsed updates (server or client timer) while
  status = streaming; surface cancel controls and live announcements after 5 s;
  cover with unit + Playwright tests.
- **Verification**: `pnpm --filter @ctrl-freaq/ai test`,
  `pnpm --filter @ctrl-freaq/web test`, Playwright flow simulating slow
  proposals.
