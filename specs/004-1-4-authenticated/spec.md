# Feature Specification: Authenticated App Layout + Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `004-1-4-authenticated` **Created**: 2025-09-15 **Status**:
Ready for Planning **Input**: Epic 1, Story 4 from PRD

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Epic 1, Story 4: Authenticated App Layout + Dashboard
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: authenticated users, two-column layout, sidebar navigation,
     projects listing, dashboard view, project list component, recent activity
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � All aspects clarified via PRD and FE spec
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Clear user flows identified for authentication and dashboard navigation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � All requirements testable and derived from PRD acceptance criteria
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   � Projects, Users, Activities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   � No clarifications needed, no implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As an authenticated user, I want to access my projects dashboard through a
consistent two-column layout, so that I can view all my projects and recent
activity in one place, with easy navigation between different areas of the
application.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user is authenticated, **When** they access the application,
   **Then** they see a two-column layout with sidebar navigation on the left and
   main content area on the right
2. **Given** an authenticated user views the sidebar, **When** they look at the
   navigation, **Then** they see a "Projects" group listing their projects
   sorted alphabetically by name
3. **Given** a user is on the dashboard, **When** they view the main content
   area, **Then** they see two columns: Project List (left) and Recent Activity
   (right)
4. **Given** a user views their Project List on the dashboard, **When** they
   look at each project card, **Then** they see the project name, summary,
   member avatar, and last modified placeholder ("/N/A" for MVP)
5. **Given** a user has no recent activity, **When** they view the Recent
   Activity column, **Then** they see the message "No recent activity yet"
6. **Given** a user selects a project from the sidebar, **When** they click on
   it, **Then** the active project is reflected in the application state and UI
7. **Given** a user accesses the application, **When** they first log in,
   **Then** they are automatically routed to the dashboard view

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has no projects? Display appropriate empty state in
  Project List
- How does system handle slow loading of project data? Show loading states
  before data arrives
- What if authentication fails? User should be redirected to login
- How does layout adapt on mobile devices? Basic responsive behavior should
  maintain usability

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display a two-column authenticated layout protected by
  authentication
- **FR-002**: System MUST show a persistent sidebar containing a "Projects"
  group with the user's projects sorted alphabetically by name
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to select a project from the sidebar and
  track the active project state
- **FR-004**: System MUST route authenticated users to the dashboard view by
  default upon login
- **FR-005**: Dashboard MUST display an h1 heading with text "Dashboard"
- **FR-006**: Dashboard MUST show a two-column layout with Project List on the
  left and Recent Activity on the right
- **FR-007**: Project List component MUST display each project with name,
  summary, member avatar(s), and last modified information
- **FR-008**: System MUST show "/N/A" for last modified fields in MVP
  (placeholder for future functionality)
- **FR-009**: System MUST display user avatars from user profile data when
  available
- **FR-010**: Recent Activity component MUST show "No recent activity yet" as
  the MVP empty state
- **FR-011**: System MUST source project data from the project data source
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide basic responsive behavior for different screen
  sizes
- **FR-013**: System MUST include empty states for all data-driven components
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain local-only operation for MVP (no remote
  servers required)
- **FR-015**: User profile navigation in sidebar MUST be present as a
  placeholder (non-functional for MVP)

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: System MUST log all authentication events per security
  requirements
- **NFR-002**: Dashboard MUST load within performance targets defined in
  architecture
- **NFR-003**: System MUST handle authentication failures gracefully with
  appropriate user feedback

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Project**: Represents a user's project with name, summary, member list, and
  modification metadata
- **User**: Authenticated user with profile data from the authentication
  provider including avatar and email
- **Activity**: Placeholder for future document change tracking (empty in MVP)
