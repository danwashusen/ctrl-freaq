# Feature Specification: Section Editor & WYSIWYG Capabilities

**Feature Branch**: `[007-epic-2-story]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Epic 2, Story 3"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A staff-level engineer working on a project opens an architecture document, sees
which sections need attention, and uses the section editor to review existing
content, switch into editing mode, apply rich text formatting, and preview their
changes before deciding whether to keep editing or finalize the section.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a document section is in read-only preview, **When** the user
   chooses to edit it, **Then** the editor presents an intuitive rich text mode
   with formatting controls aligned to the architecture template guidance.
2. **Given** the user has made edits within a section, **When** they request a
   review, **Then** the editor displays a side-by-side comparison of the draft
   and the approved content so the user can confirm the changes before saving.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when multiple unsaved edits conflict with newer approved content
  from another collaborator?
- How does the system handle very large sections that exceed typical page length
  without overwhelming the editor interface?
- What should the user experience be when formatting options fail to apply due
  to validation rules or unsupported styling?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST present each document section in a clear read-only
  view that summarizes current approval status and invites editing when needed.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to enter and exit section edit mode
  without losing previously approved content or draft changes.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to apply rich text formatting (headings,
  emphasis, lists, tables, code blocks, blockquotes) that matches the
  architecture template guidance.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide an at-a-glance comparison that highlights the
  differences between draft edits and the latest approved section content.
- **FR-005**: System MUST capture a section-level note or summary of edits so
  reviewers understand why changes were made.
- **FR-006**: System MUST warn users about conflicting drafts when collaboration
  overlaps occur and surface options to reconcile the state.
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure accessibility standards are upheld for the
  editor interface, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- **FR-008**: System MUST support autosave or draft preservation so the user can
  safely resume editing after interruptions.
- **FR-009**: System MUST expose the full range of Markdown-formatting controls
  (headings, emphasis, lists, tables, links, code, quotes) so users can author
  sections without leaving the editor.
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow any user with access to the project or document
  to approve a section, transitioning it from draft to read-only state while
  recording the approver, timestamp, and decision summary.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Document Section**: Represents a discrete portion of the architecture
  document with metadata for status, last edited by, and approved content.
- **Section Draft**: Captures in-progress edits, applied formatting choices, and
  timestamps so users can resume work or compare changes.
- **Review Summary**: Stores reviewer comments, approval decisions, and change
  rationale that accompany a section update.

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- Section templates and guidance are already available from the document schema
  system to drive formatting expectations.
- Users accessing the editor have project-level permissions managed elsewhere in
  the platform.
- Collaboration safeguards (e.g., conflict detection) rely on existing document
  state tracking across clients.
