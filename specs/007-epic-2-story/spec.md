# Feature Specification: Section Editor & WYSIWYG Capabilities

**Feature Branch**: `[007-epic-2-story]`  
**Created**: 2025-09-22  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Epic 2, Story 3"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-24

- Q: When should the system perform conflict detection to warn about overlapping
  drafts? → A: Hybrid: initial check on entry plus another on save/submit.

- Q: When the editor detects that a user's draft conflicts with newly approved
  content for the same section, how should the system handle the resolution
  before the user can finalize their changes? → A: Force the draft to rebase
  onto the newest approved content, prompting the user to reapply and review
  their edits before continuing.

- Q: When a section grows unusually long, how should the editor keep the
  interface manageable for the user? → A: Render it all.

- Q: If a formatting action fails because it violates validation rules or uses
  unsupported styling, how should the editor respond in the moment? → A: Allow
  the formatting but highlight the unsupported portion for later resolution.

- Q: What autosave cadence should the section editor use to preserve drafts
  without overwhelming the backend? → A: Manual "Save Draft" action only, no
  automatic sync.

- Q: When a user switches a section from read-only preview into edit mode, what
  performance target should we hold so the transition feels responsive? → A:
  Transition completes within 300 ms.

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A staff-level engineer working on a project opens an architecture document, sees
which sections need attention, and uses the section editor to review existing
content, switch into editing mode, apply rich text formatting, and preview their
changes before deciding whether to keep editing or finalize the section.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a document section is in read-only preview, **When** the user
   chooses to edit it, **Then** the editor switches to rich text mode within 300
   ms, shows a formatting toolbar (headings, emphasis, lists, tables, links,
   code, quotes), accepts ⌘/Ctrl+B for bold, and announces the mode change to
   screen readers.
2. **Given** the user has made edits within a section, **When** they request a
   review, **Then** the editor displays a side-by-side comparison of the draft
   and the approved content so the user can confirm the changes before saving.
3. **Given** a document section is in read-only preview, **When** a user views
   it, **Then** the interface shows approval status, reviewer summary,
   timestamp, and an accessible "Edit Section" control aligned with template
   guidance.

### Edge Cases

- When multiple unsaved edits conflict with newer approved content from another
  collaborator, the editor forces the draft to rebase onto the latest approved
  section and prompts the user to reapply and review edits before continuing.
- When sections grow unusually long (50k+ characters), the editor renders the
  full content in one continuous view without virtualization and MUST maintain
  an average 60 fps scrolling experience measured via telemetry; show a loading
  indicator if initial render exceeds 500 ms.
- If formatting actions violate validation rules or attempt unsupported styling,
  the editor still applies the formatting but flags the unsupported portion for
  later resolution so the user can review before finalizing.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST present each document section in a clear read-only
  view that summarizes current approval status and invites editing when needed.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to enter and exit section edit mode
  without losing previously approved content or draft changes.
- **FR-003**: System MUST expose a formatting toolbar with controls for
  headings, emphasis, ordered and unordered lists, tables, links, code blocks,
  and blockquotes, and MUST honor keyboard shortcuts (⌘/Ctrl+B for bold,
  ⌘/Ctrl+I for italics, ⌘/Ctrl+K for link) while matching architecture template
  guidance.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide an at-a-glance comparison that highlights the
  differences between draft edits and the latest approved section content.
- **FR-005**: System MUST capture a section-level note or summary of edits so
  reviewers understand why changes were made.
- **FR-006**: System MUST run conflict detection when entering edit mode and
  again on save/submit to warn users of overlapping drafts, force the draft to
  rebase onto the newest approved content, and prompt the user to reapply and
  review edits before continuing.
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure accessibility standards are upheld for the
  editor interface, including keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a manual "Save Draft" action to preserve work
  between sessions; automatic background autosave is not required, but saved
  drafts MUST persist after closing the editor.
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow authorized project users to approve a section,
  transitioning it from draft to read-only while persisting approver identity,
  timestamp, decision summary, and emitting an auditable event aligned with
  shared-data schemas.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: Section edit mode transitions MUST complete within 300 ms to
  maintain a responsive experience when switching from read-only preview.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Document Section**: Represents a discrete portion of the architecture
  document with metadata for status, last edited by, and approved content.
- **Section Draft**: Captures in-progress edits, applied formatting choices, and
  timestamps so users can resume work or compare changes.
- **Review Summary**: Stores reviewer comments, approval decisions, and change
  rationale that accompany a section update.

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- Section templates and guidance are already available from the document schema
  system to drive formatting expectations.
- Users accessing the editor have project-level permissions managed elsewhere in
  the platform.
- Collaboration safeguards (e.g., conflict detection) rely on existing document
  state tracking across clients.
