# Implementation Plan: Section Editor & WYSIWYG Capabilities

**Branch**: `[007-epic-2-story]` | **Date**: 2025-09-23 | **Spec**:
`specs/007-epic-2-story/spec.md` **Input**: Feature specification from
`/specs/007-epic-2-story/spec.md`

## Summary

- Deliver section-level WYSIWYG editing that mirrors architecture template
  guidance, preserves drafts through autosave, and provides side-by-side diffs
  prior to approval.
- Extend existing editor and persistence libraries with Milkdown-powered UI,
  optimistic locking, and audit-ready workflows that satisfy FR-001 → FR-010.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x on Node.js 20 runtime  
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18, Express.js, Milkdown 7.15.5, TanStack Query,
Zod, Vitest, Playwright  
**Storage**: SQLite via `packages/editor-persistence` repositories with
forward-compatible DynamoDB migration path  
**Testing**: Vitest unit/integration/contract suites, Playwright E2E,
`pnpm  test:contracts` enforced before backend changes  
**Target Platform**: Web (React frontend + Express API server)  
**Project Type**: web  
**Performance Goals**: Keep editor interactions under 200 ms for sections up to
500 blocks; autosave acknowledgements under 1 s round-trip  
**Constraints**: Library-first architecture, CLI exposure for core flows, WCAG
2.1 AA accessibility, optimistic locking for collaborative edits, structured
logging with request IDs  
**Scale/Scope**: Staff engineers collaborating on architecture docs (~500
sections, concurrent editing and review)  
**Planning Source**: `specs/007-epic-2-story/`  
**Coding Standards**: TypeScript-first linting, Prettier formatting, protected
quality gates, structured logging per `docs/architecture.md` and
`CONSTITUTION.md`  
**Test Strategy and Standards**: Vitest-driven TDD, Playwright regression,
contract coverage prior to implementation, CI gates (`pnpm lint`,
`pnpm  typecheck`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:contracts`)

## Constitution Check

- Library-First Architecture: Work concentrates in `packages/section-editor` and
  `packages/editor-persistence` with CLI support; no bypass of library-first
  mandate. **Status: PASS**
- CLI Interface Standard: Plan adds/updates CLI entry
  `packages/section-editor/src/cli/section-editor.ts` for diff generation.
  **PASS**
- Test-First Development: Tasks enforce contract/integration/unit tests before
  implementation (T004–T011 precede T012+). **PASS**
- Observability & Auditability: Request ID propagation and logging tasks (T026)
  ensure compliance with constitutional logging rules. **PASS**

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 — Web application (frontend + backend)

## Phase 0: Research Summary

- Consolidated unknowns and design options in
  `specs/007-epic-2-story/research.md`, covering coding standards, test
  strategy, editor stack, autosave, conflicts, accessibility, and performance.
- Additional research sections summarize backend, frontend, and UX architecture
  implications for the feature.

## Phase 1: Design Outputs

- `data-model.md` details DocumentSection, SectionDraft, and ReviewSummary
  schemas, state transitions, and validation rules.
- `contracts/section-editor.openapi.yaml` defines five REST endpoints supporting
  read, draft, diff, review, and approval flows with shared schemas.
- `contracts/tests/section-editor.contract.test.ts` seeds failing Vitest cases
  for each contract; `quickstart.md` documents validation flow.

## Phase 2: Task Planning

- `tasks.md` enumerates T001–T033 with TDD ordering, parallelization guidance,
  and dependencies across persistence, API, frontend, and documentation work.
- Contract, entity, and user-story coverage confirmed in checklist and
  dependency section.

## Phase 3: Research Amendments

- `research.md` now includes "Phase 3 Readiness Notes" capturing contract scope,
  frontend focus areas, and audit logging reminders for implementation.
