# Code Review Report: Section Editor & WYSIWYG Capabilities (007-epic-2-story)

## Final Status: **Approved** _(Approved | Changes Requested | Blocked: Missing Context | Blocked: Scope Mismatch | Needs Clarification | TDD Violation | Quality Controls Violation | Security Gate Failure | Privacy Gate Failure | Supply Chain Violation | Dependency Vulnerabilities | Deprecated Dependencies | Review Pending)_

## Resolved Scope

**Branch**: `007-epic-2-story` **Baseline**: `main` **Diff Source**:
`git diff main..HEAD` **Review Target**: Section editor backend routes/services,
diff integration, and contract coverage refresh **Files Analyzed**: 23 changed
files including backend routes/services, DI container wiring, contract
fixtures/tests, pnpm lockfile regeneration, and specification templates

**Resolved Scope Narrative**: Focused on the API slice that replaces demo
fixture seeding with per-request service resolution, swaps the diff stub for the
editor-core generator, and hardens contract fixtures/tests for conflict, draft,
diff, submit, and approval flows. Documentation/template churn was noted but not
re-audited in depth for this pass.

**Feature Directory**:
`/Users/danwas/Development/Projects/ctrl-freaq/specs/007-epic-2-story`
**Implementation Scope**:

- apps/api/src/routes/sections.ts
- apps/api/src/modules/section-editor/services/section-diff.service.ts
- apps/api/src/services/container.ts
- apps/api/src/testing/fixtures/section-editor.ts
- apps/api/tests/contract/section-editor/section-editor.contract.test.ts
- apps/api/package.json

## Pre-Review Gates

| Gate                      | Status         | Details                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Context Gate**          | Pass           | `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `spec.md`, `data-model.md`, `research.md`, and `quickstart.md` present under `specs/007-epic-2-story/`. |
| **Change Intent Gate**    | Pass           | Changes align with POR: API now consumes DI services, real diff generator, and hardened fixtures/tests.                        |
| **Unknowns Gate**         | Pass           | No unresolved `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers surfaced in dossier.                                                             |
| **Separation of Duties**  | Not Evaluated  | Local review context; branch protection metadata unavailable.                                                                  |
| **Code Owners Gate**      | Not Configured | `.github/CODEOWNERS` absent, so owner enforcement cannot be confirmed.                                                         |
| **Quality Controls Gate** | Pass           | `pnpm --filter @ctrl-freaq/api lint` / `typecheck` / targeted contract suite all green.                                        |
| **TDD Evidence Gate**     | Pass           | Contract test suite exercises the updated endpoints end-to-end post-fixture refactor.                                          |

## Findings

No findings in this pass; the change set meets the scoped requirements.

## Strengths

- routes resolve repositories/services from the DI container instead of mutating
  demo fixtures, keeping production paths clean and testable
  (`apps/api/src/routes/sections.ts:60`).
- diff service now reuses `generateSectionDiff` with section/draft metadata so
  clients receive structured hunks that match FR-004
  (`apps/api/src/modules/section-editor/services/section-diff.service.ts:44`).
- dedicated fixture helpers seed documents/drafts/conflict history for contract
  coverage, tightening the save/diff/approve assertions
  (`apps/api/src/testing/fixtures/section-editor.ts:1`,
  `apps/api/tests/contract/section-editor/section-editor.contract.test.ts:31`).

## Outstanding Clarifications

- None.

## Decision Log

- Confirmed prior review findings (diff stub, fixture seeding, typecheck issues)
  are resolved in current code paths.
- Executed lint, typecheck, and contract suite to validate quality gates before
  concluding review.
- Noted pnpm lockfile regeneration; no additional third-party dependencies
  introduced beyond the workspace diff generator.
