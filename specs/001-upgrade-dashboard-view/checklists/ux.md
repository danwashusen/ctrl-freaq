**Created**: 2025-11-01  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

**Note**: This checklist is generated by the `/speckit.checklist` command based
on feature context and requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] CHK001 Are structural layout requirements documented for header, sidebar,
      and main regions across desktop and narrow viewports? [Completeness, Spec
      §FR-001; Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK002 Are content requirements for the header (product name, descriptor,
      settings, account access) explicitly enumerated for all supported
      viewports? [Completeness, Spec §FR-002; Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK003 Are sidebar list composition rules (sorting, lifecycle badges,
      active state, live data dependency) fully captured? [Completeness, Spec
      §FR-003; Spec §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK004 Are empty, loading, and error state expectations for the sidebar
      all represented within the requirements? [Completeness, Spec §FR-005; Spec
      §FR-006; Spec §User Story 3]

## Requirement Clarity

- [ ] CHK005 Is “maintaining visual parity with the mock” defined with explicit
      allowances or constraints (spacing, typography, alignment) to avoid
      subjective interpretation? [Clarity, Spec §FR-001; Spec §Assumptions]
- [ ] CHK006 Are rules for highlighting the active project (visual treatment,
      focus indication) written so designers and testers can recognize
      compliance? [Clarity, Spec §FR-003; Spec §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK007 Is the phrase “clear call-to-action” in empty states described with
      measurable prominence (placement, visual weight)? [Clarity, Spec §FR-006;
      Spec §SC-003]

## Requirement Consistency

- [ ] CHK008 Do header interaction expectations in User Story 1 align with
      functional requirements so no conflicting action lists or arrangements
      appear? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 1; Spec §FR-002]
- [ ] CHK009 Are sidebar behavior descriptions consistent between acceptance
      scenarios and FR-004 regarding navigation, scroll retention, and
      active-state persistence? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 2; Spec §FR-004]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [ ] CHK010 Do success criteria quantify perceived clarity and task success in
      ways that map back to the specified UX behaviors (e.g., layout
      comprehension, navigation speed)? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §SC-001; Spec
      §SC-002; Spec §SC-004]
- [ ] CHK011 Are acceptance scenarios for each user story sufficient to validate
      desktop and mobile shell interactions without implementation assumptions?
      [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §User Story 1; Spec §User Story 2; Spec §User
      Story 3]

## Scenario Coverage

- [ ] CHK012 Are requirements present for transitional flows such as reopening
      the dashboard after visiting a project, ensuring the shell state is
      restored? [Coverage, Spec §FR-004; Spec §Edge Cases]
- [ ] CHK013 Are mobile overlay behaviors (toggle activation, focus trapping,
      dismissal) fully specified for both success and interruption scenarios?
      [Coverage, Spec §User Story 1; Spec §FR-008]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [ ] CHK014 Do edge cases detail treatment for long project names, overflowing
      lists, and filter-induced emptiness with explicit UX outcomes? [Edge Case
      Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases; Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK015 Is rapid sign-out/sign-in recovery, including data refresh
      expectations, described with enough specificity to guide UX validation?
      [Edge Case Coverage, Spec §Edge Cases; Spec §Assumptions]

## Non-Functional Requirements

- [ ] CHK016 Are responsiveness and perceived performance expectations (e.g.,
      sidebar population speed, navigation response) translated into UX-facing
      metrics or thresholds? [Non-Functional, Spec §SC-002; Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK017 Are accessibility expectations (landmarks, focus management,
      assistive messaging) exhaustively captured for both desktop and mobile
      experiences? [Non-Functional, Spec §FR-008; Spec §User Story 1]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [ ] CHK018 Are dependencies on existing dialogs, data sources, and design
      tokens validated so UX requirements remain accurate if those primitives
      change? [Dependencies, Spec §Assumptions; Spec §FR-006]
- [ ] CHK019 Is there documentation ensuring the mock is treated as guidance
      only, with actual data shapes driving UX decisions? [Dependencies, Spec
      §Assumptions; Spec §FR-001]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [ ] CHK020 Are any subjective descriptors (e.g., “clear,” “harmonized”)
      translated into objective UX criteria or referenced design tokens to avoid
      conflicting interpretations? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-001; Spec §FR-007]
- [ ] CHK021 Are there conflicts between reusing existing project cards and the
      requirement to harmonize spacing/typography that need explicit
      reconciliation? [Conflict, Spec §FR-007; Spec §Edge Cases]
