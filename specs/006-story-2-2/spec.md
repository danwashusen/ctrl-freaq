# Feature Specification: Document Editor Core Infrastructure

**Feature Branch**: `006-story-2-2`  
**Created**: 2025-09-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Story: 2.2 - Document Editor Core Infrastructure"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A senior engineer signs in to CTRL FreaQ, opens an in-progress architecture
document, uses the document-wide Table of Contents to jump to different
sections, reviews the read-only previews, and switches sections into edit mode
in any order to continue authoring content.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an architecture document with populated sections, **When** the user
   opens the editor, **Then** the Table of Contents lists all sections and
   sub-sections with navigation that jumps the viewport to the selected section.
2. **Given** a populated section in read mode, **When** the user chooses to edit
   that section, **Then** the section transitions into an edit state while
   preserving the original content for review and later returning to read mode
   after save or cancel.
3. **Given** a section with no existing content, **When** the user navigates to
   it, **Then** the editor displays a placeholder explaining the section purpose
   and offers the option to begin drafting content.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the document template introduces a new section while a user
  session is active?
- How does the system handle navigation to a section whose content fails to load
  from persistence?
- What is the user experience when the document contains deeply nested sections
  exceeding the visible height of the Table of Contents panel?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST present a hierarchical Table of Contents that
  reflects the active document template and allows users to jump directly to any
  section or sub-section.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST render each section in a read-only preview state
  by default, including section title, status, and most recent content.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST enable users to enter and exit edit mode for any
  section without enforcing a specific order, supporting both save and cancel
  actions.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST display descriptive placeholders for sections that
  have no stored content, guiding the user on what information belongs in that
  section.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST maintain clear visual cues that distinguish
  between read mode, edit mode, and placeholder states so users always
  understand a section's current state.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST keep navigation responsive when sections are
  added, removed, or reordered so the Table of Contents and section views stay
  synchronized.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST surface section-level status changes (for example,
  whether editing is in progress or ready for review) consistent with the
  defined section lifecycle.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Document**: Represents the architecture artifact being authored, containing
  metadata (title, owner, decision policy) and an ordered collection of
  sections.
- **Section Instance**: Represents a single section within the document,
  including identifier, title, status, rendered content, placeholder copy, and
  links to lifecycle metadata.

### Dependencies & Assumptions

- The architecture document template continues to supply section ordering,
  labels, and placeholder copy consumed by the editor experience.
- Section lifecycle states are produced by the shared workflow engine delivered
  in adjacent editor stories and remain accessible to the UI.
- Document persistence services already expose section content and metadata
  required to populate previews and placeholders.
