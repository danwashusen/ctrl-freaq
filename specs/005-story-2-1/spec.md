# Feature Specification: Document Schema & Template System

**Feature Branch**: `005-story-2-1`  
**Created**: 2025-09-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Story: 2.1 - Document Schema & Template System

Primary Sources:

- PRD path: docs/prd.md#epic-2-details--document-editor-core
- PRD excerpt: <<PRD_EXCERPT_START>>

1. Document Schema & Template System

- AC1: JSON schema defines sections/fields, required/optional, and types with
  version tracking.
- AC2: Document Template YAML system (e.g., Architecture Document Template, PRD
  Template) drives editor rendering.
- AC3: Runtime validation enforces schema in UI and on save/export.
  <<PRD_EXCERPT_END>>
- FE spec path: docs/front-end-spec.md#core-document-editor-workflow
- FE excerpt: <<FE_EXCERPT_START>>

1. Load Template: App loads the Architecture template from repository YAML
   (e.g., `templates/architecture.yaml`). If absent, seed from
   `.bmad-core/templates/architecture-tmpl.yaml` and persist as
   `templates/architecture.yaml` for ongoing source-of-truth editing.
2. Save & Export: Batch save all modified sections to document repository.
   Export to `docs/architecture.md` and shards `docs/architecture/*.md` is
   available on-demand via explicit user action (export button/command).
   <<FE_EXCERPT_END>>

Constraints:

- Treat PRD/FE excerpts as canonical for WHAT/WHY.
- If any conflict with user free-text, prefer these excerpts and surface a
  clarification question.

Open Questions:

- None"

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A documentation program manager configures the standardized Architecture
Document template so every project team drafts within the same structure,
ensuring reviewers see consistent sections, field expectations, and version
identifiers across the organization.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a new Architecture Document template is requested, **When** the
   manager defines sections, field requirements, and default descriptors,
   **Then** the template is saved with a version label and is immediately
   available for editors in the document creation flow.
2. **Given** an editor opens an existing document that depends on the template,
   **When** they navigate or attempt to save changes, **Then** the UI validates
   each section against the schema and blocks invalid or missing required
   content with clear guidance on what must be resolved.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a template version referenced by an existing document is
  deprecated or missing?
- How does system handle documents created before a schema update but opened
  after it is published?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a canonical catalog of document templates
  that defines every section, subsection, and field expected for the
  Architecture Document.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST capture field-level metadata (type,
  required/optional status, guidance text) in a structured schema so editors
  understand expectations while drafting.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST assign and store explicit version identifiers for
  each template update and retain prior versions for auditing and rollback
  needs.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST allow document creation flows to reference the
  active template version and render placeholders or preview content based on
  that schema.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST validate user-edited content against the template
  schema during editing and before save/export, preventing completion when
  required elements are missing or field types are invalid.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST allow controlled publishing of template updates so
  that editors receive the newest version without disrupting in-progress drafts.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Document Template**: The governed blueprint containing the ordered list of
  sections, subsections, field definitions, guidance copy, and publication
  status for a document type.
- **Template Version**: A snapshot of the template with a unique identifier,
  effective date, changelog summary, and reference to the authorizing manager.
- **Section Definition**: Metadata for an individual section or field, including
  its hierarchy position, required/optional flag, expected content type, and
  descriptive prompt used in editor placeholders.
