# Feature Specification: Development Environment Bootstrap

**Feature Branch**: `002-1-1-development`
**Created**: 2025-09-13
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Epic 1, Story 1"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Epic 1, Story 1 identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: monorepo setup, frontend adaptation, backend creation, library packages, test infrastructure
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All aspects are clearly defined in PRD
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User flow established for development environment setup
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement maps to specific acceptance criteria
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Development artifacts and configuration entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ No clarifications needed, all requirements testable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer setting up CTRL FreaQ for the first time, I need a complete development environment that includes both frontend and backend applications, along with all supporting library packages, so that I can begin developing features immediately with all necessary infrastructure in place.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a fresh clone of the repository, **When** I run the setup command, **Then** all dependencies are installed and the monorepo structure is properly configured
2. **Given** the monorepo is set up, **When** I run the development command, **Then** both frontend (port 5173) and backend (port 5001) start successfully
3. **Given** the existing lovable.ai prototype, **When** it is integrated into the monorepo, **Then** all existing features (authentication, dashboard, routing) continue working
4. **Given** the development environment is running, **When** I navigate to http://localhost:5173, **Then** I see the Dashboard with Clerk authentication working
5. **Given** the backend is running, **When** I access http://localhost:5001/health, **Then** I receive a successful health check response
6. **Given** the test infrastructure is set up, **When** I run the test command, **Then** all placeholder tests execute successfully
7. **Given** the TypeScript configuration, **When** I run typecheck, **Then** it passes with strict mode enabled
8. **Given** library packages are created, **When** I check each package, **Then** they all have CLI interfaces and follow Constitutional requirements

### Edge Cases
- What happens when required ports (5173, 5001) are already in use?
- How does system handle missing environment variables for authentication?
- What happens if the lovable.ai prototype files are not found at the expected location?
- How does the system behave when database initialization fails?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST create a complete monorepo structure with specific directories (apps/web, apps/api, packages/*, infra/, docs/, templates/, .bmad-core/)
- **FR-002**: System MUST configure pnpm workspaces to manage all packages with Turbo pipelines for lint, type-check, build, and test operations
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide root-level commands for development (dev, dev:web, dev:api), testing, linting, type checking, and building
- **FR-004**: System MUST adapt the existing lovable.ai prototype from docs/examples/ctrl-freaq-ui to serve as the frontend foundation
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve all existing lovable.ai functionality including authentication, dashboard, and routing
- **FR-006**: System MUST enhance the frontend with missing architectural components (Pino logging, path aliases, feature/store directories, streaming utilities)
- **FR-007**: System MUST create an Express.js backend server with structured JSON logging, request ID propagation, error handling, CORS configuration, and health check endpoint
- **FR-008**: System MUST establish API versioning structure with /api/v1/ base path and placeholder routes
- **FR-009**: System MUST create library packages that each include CLI entry points, main exports, independent package.json files, README documentation, and TypeScript configuration
- **FR-010**: System MUST implement minimal functionality for core packages (shared-data with SQLite/repository pattern, templates with YAML loader, ai with Vercel AI SDK wrapper)
- **FR-011**: System MUST set up test framework across monorepo with Vitest configuration and test directories in each package
- **FR-012**: System MUST create placeholder tests demonstrating unit, integration, component, API, and CLI testing patterns
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide test utilities including database setup/teardown helpers, React Testing Library configuration, and mock service locators
- **FR-014**: System MUST include development environment validation scripts to verify all services start correctly
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide comprehensive documentation including README with setup instructions, DEVELOPMENT.md with architecture overview, and Constitutional compliance checklist

### Key Entities
- **Monorepo Configuration**: Represents the pnpm workspace configuration and Turbo pipeline definitions
- **Frontend Application**: The adapted lovable.ai prototype with enhanced architecture components
- **Backend Application**: Express.js server with API versioning and middleware stack
- **Library Packages**: Independent packages following Constitutional requirements with CLI interfaces
- **Test Infrastructure**: Testing framework configuration and placeholder tests across all packages
- **Development Scripts**: Automation scripts for environment validation and service management
