# Tasks: Development Environment Bootstrap

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-1-1-development/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ✓, research.md ✓, data-model.md ✓, contracts/ ✓

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   ✓ Loaded successfully - Tech stack: TypeScript 5.4.x, Express.js 5.1.0, React 18.3.x
   ✓ Structure: Web app with apps/web and apps/api
   ✓ Libraries: 8 packages with CLI interfaces
2. Load optional design documents:
   ✓ data-model.md: 5 entities (User, Project, Configuration, AppVersion, ActivityLog)
   ✓ contracts/: 2 contract files (health-check.yaml, projects-api.yaml)
   ✓ research.md: Service Locator, Pino logging, Repository pattern, pnpm+Turborepo
3. Generate tasks by category:
   ✓ Setup: Monorepo, dependencies, linting (5 tasks)
   ✓ Tests: Contract tests, integration tests (8 tasks)
   ✓ Core: Library packages, CLI interfaces (24 tasks)
   ✓ Integration: Frontend, backend, middleware (8 tasks)
   ✓ Polish: Documentation, scripts (3 tasks)
4. Apply task rules:
   ✓ Different files = [P] for parallel execution
   ✓ Same file = sequential (no [P])
   ✓ Tests before implementation (TDD mandatory)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T048)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   ✓ All contracts have tests? YES (2 contracts → 2 test tasks)
   ✓ All entities have models? YES (5 entities → 5 model tasks)
   ✓ All endpoints implemented? YES (6 endpoints → 6 implementation tasks)
9. Return: SUCCESS (48 tasks ready for execution)
```

## Phase 3.6: Code Review Feedback from 2025-09-14 07:25

### Critical Issues

- [ ] T052: [Security] Missing User model implementation — File:
      packages/shared-data/src/models/user.ts - Why: User entity is in
      data-model.md but has no implementation (impacts authentication flow) -
      Severity: Critical - Fix: Create User model with Zod schema validation per
      T036 pattern - Links: data-model.md#user-entity

- [ ] T053: [Correctness] Missing base repository implementation — File:
      packages/shared-data/src/repositories/base-repository.ts[:40] - Why: T040
      task exists but implementation missing (blocks all repository pattern
      usage) - Severity: Critical - Fix: Implement BaseRepository abstract class
      with generic CRUD operations - Links: research.md#repository-pattern,
      tasks.md#T040

- [ ] T054: [Testing] Health check test imports non-existent module — File:
      apps/api/tests/contract/health-check.test.ts:23 - Why: Import uses .js
      extension instead of TypeScript module resolution - Severity: Major - Fix:
      Change import to `await import('../../src/app')` without .js extension -
      Links: TypeScript module resolution docs

### Major Issues

- [ ] T055: [Security] Request ID generation lacks cryptographic security —
      File: apps/api/src/core/logging.ts:185 - Why: Uses Math.random() for ID
      generation instead of crypto.randomBytes - Severity: Major - Fix: Replace
      with crypto.randomUUID() or nanoid for secure ID generation - Links:
      CONSTITUTION.md#security-requirements

- [ ] T056: [API/Contract] Missing API route implementations — File:
      apps/api/src/routes/ - Why: No route files exist despite T041-T046 tasks -
      Severity: Major - Fix: Implement health.ts and projects.ts route
      handlers - Links: contracts/health-check.yaml, contracts/projects-api.yaml

- [ ] T057: [Performance] Service locator disposal race condition — File:
      apps/api/src/core/service-locator.ts:262-273 - Why: Duplicate disposal on
      both 'finish' and 'close' events can cause errors - Severity: Major - Fix:
      Add disposal flag check to prevent double disposal - Links: Express.js
      response lifecycle

### Minor Issues

- [ ] T058: [Maintainability] CLI uses mixed import patterns — File:
      packages/shared-data/src/cli.ts:396,407 - Why: Uses require() for utils
      while rest uses ES modules - Severity: Minor - Fix: Convert to consistent
      ES module imports - Links: Node.js ES modules best practices

- [ ] T059: [Observability] Missing database query parameter logging — File:
      apps/api/src/core/logging.ts:117 - Why: Only logs hasParameters boolean,
      not parameter names for debugging - Severity: Minor - Fix: Log parameter
      keys (not values) for query debugging - Links:
      CONSTITUTION.md#logging-requirements

- [ ] T060: [Testing] Mock validation messages don't test actual behavior —
      File: packages/shared-data/src/cli.ts:167 - Why: Returns hardcoded warning
      instead of actual validation - Severity: Minor - Fix: Implement actual
      schema validation logic - Links: tasks.md#T020-T021

### Architecture Alignment Issues

- [ ] T061: [Architecture] Service container doesn't implement transaction scope
      — File: apps/api/src/core/service-locator.ts:183 - Why: Database factory
      comment mentions transactions but doesn't implement - Severity: Major -
      Fix: Implement transaction wrapper for database operations - Links:
      research.md#repository-pattern

- [ ] T062: [Constitution] Missing required audit fields in error logs — File:
      apps/api/src/core/errors.ts:359-366 - Why: Doesn't log
      created_by/updated_by per SOC 2 requirements - Severity: Major - Fix: Add
      user context to all error logs - Links:
      CONSTITUTION.md#rule-14-audit-fields
