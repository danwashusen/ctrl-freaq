# Development Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Library-First Architecture
Every feature begins as a standalone library with clear boundaries and responsibilities. Libraries must be:
- Self-contained with minimal external dependencies
- Independently testable and documented
- Purpose-driven with explicit functionality scope
- Reusable across different contexts and projects

No organizational-only libraries—each must solve a concrete problem.

### II. CLI Interface Standard
Every library exposes core functionality through a command-line interface following strict protocols:
- **Input**: Command-line arguments and/or stdin
- **Output**: Results to stdout, errors to stderr
- **Formats**: Support both JSON and human-readable output
- **Behavior**: Consistent flag patterns and error codes

Text-based I/O ensures debuggability and composability.

### III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Test-driven development is mandatory and strictly enforced:
1. **Tests written first** → User/stakeholder approval → Tests fail → Implementation
2. **Red-Green-Refactor cycle** must be followed without exception
3. **Test coverage** must include edge cases and error conditions
4. **Test isolation** ensures independent, repeatable execution

No implementation without failing tests that define the requirements.

### IV. Integration Testing Requirements
Integration tests are required for specific change categories:
- New library public APIs and contracts
- Changes to existing library interfaces
- Inter-service or cross-system communication
- Shared data schemas and protocols
- Real dependency interactions (no mocking for integration layer)

Focus on contract validation and system boundary verification.

### V. Observability Standards
All systems must provide comprehensive observability through:
- **Structured logging** with consistent formats and levels
- **Multi-tier log streaming** for real-time and historical analysis
- **Performance metrics** collection and monitoring
- **Error tracking** with context and stack traces
- **Health checks** and service status endpoints

Debugging capability is non-negotiable.

### VI. Versioning & Breaking Changes
Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) with strict change management:
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes require migration documentation
- **MINOR**: New features with backward compatibility
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes and internal improvements
- **Breaking changes** must include deprecation periods and migration paths
- **Version dependencies** explicitly tracked and managed

### VII. Simplicity & Minimalism
Complexity must be justified and minimized:
- **YAGNI principle**: Implement only current requirements
- **Prefer composition** over inheritance and complex abstractions
- **Limit project scope** to essential functionality
- **Remove unused code** and dependencies regularly
- **Question every dependency** and abstraction layer

Start simple, evolve incrementally based on real needs.

## Development Standards

### Code Quality Requirements
- All code must pass static analysis and linting
- Code reviews required for all changes with at least one approval
- Documentation updated with code changes
- Performance regression testing for critical paths
- Security scanning for vulnerabilities and exposed secrets

### Architecture Guidelines
- Loose coupling between components and services
- Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
- Immutable data structures where possible
- Fail-fast error handling with meaningful messages
- Graceful degradation for non-critical failures

## Governance

### Constitution Authority
This constitution supersedes all other development practices and guidelines. All project decisions must align with these principles.

### Amendment Process
Constitution changes require:
1. **Documentation** of proposed changes with rationale
2. **Stakeholder approval** through formal review process
3. **Migration plan** for existing code and practices
4. **Template updates** to maintain consistency across documentation

### Compliance Verification
- All pull requests must demonstrate compliance with applicable principles
- Code reviews must verify adherence to constitutional requirements
- Complexity introduced must be explicitly justified against simplicity principle
- Regular audits to ensure ongoing compliance
