**Key Gaps Observed**

- Project page loads template metadata with the project id, triggering
  `TEMPLATE_UPGRADE_NOT_FOUND` and leaving the upgrade UI inert
  (`apps/web/src/pages/Project.tsx:325-380`,
  `apps/web/src/stores/template-store.ts:161-268`).
- Document workflow cards are static; “Create Document”, “Edit Templates”, and
  “Export Project” never invoke actions
  (`apps/web/src/pages/Project.tsx:1221-1256`).
- The document editor (routing, quality gates, co-authoring, QA) exists but is
  unreachable from the UI (`apps/web/src/app/router/document-routes.tsx:1-94`,
  `apps/web/src/features/document-editor/components/document-editor.tsx:1-330`).
- Hooks/services for live data fetches remain unused because the editor only
  hydrates fixture data
  (`apps/web/src/features/document-editor/hooks/use-document-fixture.ts:1-120`,
  `.../quality-gates/components/DocumentQualityDashboard.tsx:1-160`,
  `.../hooks/useCoAuthorSession.ts:1-200`).

**Integration Plan**

- **Project ↔ Document wiring**
  - Add a backend endpoint to expose or seed a project’s primary document id and
    sections; use it to drive `useTemplateStore.loadDocument` with the real
    document id (`apps/web/src/pages/Project.tsx:325-380`,
    `apps/web/src/stores/template-store.ts:161-268`).
  - Replace the “Document not found” copy with a CTA that launches document
    provisioning when metadata is missing.
- **Document creation & navigation**
  - Implement `useCreateDocument` (new API client mutation) and trigger it from
    the “Create Document” card; route to
    `/documents/:documentId/sections/:firstSectionId` after creation.
  - Convert workflow cards into accessible buttons/links with loading and error
    states (`apps/web/src/pages/Project.tsx:1221-1256`).
  - Add breadcrumb/back links so users can move between project view and
    document editor per the front-end spec.
- **Editor bootstrap for real data**
  - Introduce a live-data bootstrap hook that fetches sections, metadata, ToC,
    and assumption sessions via the existing services, populating the editor and
    document stores (mirroring fixtures but using `SectionsApiService` and
    quality APIs).
  - Render explicit loading and 404 states and hydrate scroll/session metadata
    so the Table of Contents stays in sync.
- **Section editing & persistence**
  - Wire `ManualSavePanel`, diff viewer, review, and approval controls to the
    Section Editor client, including auth token handling and optimistic updates
    (`apps/web/src/features/section-editor/components/manual-save-panel.tsx:1-200`,
    `.../api/section-editor.client.ts:1-200`).
  - Surface conflict logs and retry flows when the draft bundle or compliance
    checks reject changes.
- **Assumptions, co-authoring, and QA**
  - Enable the assumptions flow by pointing session storage and streaming
    subscriptions at real project/document ids
    (`apps/web/src/features/document-editor/assumptions-flow/hooks/use-assumptions-flow.ts:1-200`).
  - Connect the co-author sidebar and Document QA panel to streaming endpoints,
    exposing cancel/retry controls
    (`.../components/co-authoring/CoAuthorSidebar.tsx`,
    `.../document-qa/DocumentQaPanel.tsx:6-80`).
  - Hook the quality dashboard actions to quality gate endpoints and display SLA
    and traceability feedback
    (`apps/web/src/features/document-editor/quality-gates/components/DocumentQualityDashboard.tsx:1-200`).
- **Template editing & export actions**
  - Persist TemplateValidationGate changes by calling the template upgrade
    service and showing success/error feedback
    (`apps/web/src/pages/Project.tsx:1123-1216`,
    `apps/web/src/stores/template-store.ts:161-268`).
  - Wire “Edit Templates” to a management view and “Export Project” to backend
    export tasks (`@ctrl-freaq/exporter`), returning downloadable artifacts.
- **Settings & global actions (follow-up)**
  - Replace placeholder settings buttons with real forms/mutations or hide them
    until supported (`apps/web/src/pages/Settings.tsx:1-180`).
