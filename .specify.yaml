            Treat the OWASP Top 10:2025 guidance as required design and coding controls throughout
            implementation. For every task, confirm mitigations for A01–A10 (access control, security
            configuration, supply chain, cryptography, injection, insecure design, authentication,
            data integrity, logging/alerting, exceptional handling) are built in and documented.
            Note any gaps or compensating controls in tasks.md and implementation logs before moving
            on to subsequent phases.
